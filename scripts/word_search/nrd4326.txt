In 2014 an estimated 112,200 patients will
be diagnosed with malignant melanoma in
the United States and five major European
markets. More than 90% will be diagnosed
early when the disease is resectable1.
However, when discovered late, the prognosis
is poor.

malignant melanoma. Both drugs achieved
statistically significant improvements in
progression-free survival in Phase III
studies. Trametinib had response rates
of 22% compared with 52% for dabrafenib.
A combination of dabrafenib and trametinib
was granted accelerated approval by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600E
or BRAFV600K malignant melanoma, based
on Phase I/II trials. These findings were
replicated in the Phase III COMBI-d trial,
achieving a median progression-free survival
of 9.3 months (compared with 8.8 months
for dabrafenib monotherapy), and a 67%
response rate. Moreover, the combination was
associated with a reduction in the incidence
of cutaneous hyperproliferative events (2%)
compared with dabrafenib alone (9%).
Although the combination of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors prolongs response to therapy,
acquired resistance is inevitable; and although
immunotherapy offers the potential for
durable responses, few patients will benefit.

Current treatment options
Prior to 2011, the mainstay of treatment
for unresectable malignant melanoma was
cytotoxic therapy, notably dacarbazine, which
is characterized by low response rates (10%)
and poor survival (12-month overall survival
is 36%). In 2011, two important drugs were
approved. Ipilimumab (Yervoy; Bristol-Myers
Squibb), a first-in-class monoclonal antibody
that targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4
(CTLA4) — a negative regulator of cytotoxic
T cell activation — is associated with low
response rates (11%), but responses are
frequently durable, extending to several
years. Vemurafenib, a small-molecule
inhibitor (Zelboraf; Roche/Genentech/

Daiichi Sankyo/Chugai) is another
first-in-class drug that is marketed with a
companion diagnostic (Cobas 4800 BRAF
V600 Mutation Test; Roche). It targets
the V600E mutation in the BRAF enzyme,
which is found in 40–50% of patients.
It shows a 3.9-month median overall survival
benefit over dacarbazine. Although response
rates to vemurafenib are high (57%) and
rapid, resistance to treatment usually develops
within 6 months. Ipilimumab is currently
used to treat up to 30% of BRAFV600E-positive
patients with low tumour burden, owing to
the potential for durable responses1.
In May 2013, two additional
targeted therapies, dabrafenib (Tafinlar;
GlaxoSmithKline) and trametinib
(Mekinist; GlaxoSmithKline), as well as the
ThxID-BRAF (BioMérieux) companion
diagnostic test, were approved. Dabrafenib
also inhibits BRAFV600E, whereas trametinib
is a first-to-market MAPK/ERK (MEK)
inhibitor that is approved for use in BRAFV600E
and the less common BRAFV600K-mutated

FROM THE ANALYST’S COUCH
▶ Late-stage drug pipeline

Several BRAF and MEK inhibitors are in
late-stage clinical development1,2 (TABLE 1).
The MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (Roche/
Genentech/Exelixis) is being evaluated
in a Phase III study in combination
with vemurafenib. In a Phase Ib study,
cobimetinib/vemurafenib achieved a
response rate of 87% in BRAF-inhibitor-naive
patients. The MEK inhibitor binimetinib
(MEK162; Novartis/Array) has potential for
the treatment of NRAS-mutated malignant
melanoma (accounting for approximately
15–25% of patients), but response rates are
low (20% in both NRAS- and BRAF-mutated
patients). Binimetinib is also being
evaluated in a three-armed Phase III study
in combination with the BRAF inhibitor
encorafenib (LGX818; Novartis) versus
encorafenib and vemurafenib monotherapies.
Programmed cell death protein 1
(PD1)-directed monoclonal antibodies,
a novel class of immune checkpoint inhibitors,
are also in Phase III clinical development.
In December 2013, nivolumab (Bristol-Myers
Squibb/Ono) was filed for regulatory approval
in Japan based on Phase II data; this is the first
global filing of an anti-PD1 agent. Nivolumab
is in three Phase III studies in the United States
and Europe. Phase Ib data for nivolumab are
remarkable, with high response rates (41%)
and durable responses (median overall survival
is 20 months). Nivolumab combined with
ipilimumab achieved an even higher response
rate (53%). Responses were also rapid and
durable (82% of responses were ongoing at
analysis), with an unprecedented median

overall survival of 40 months. However, the
higher incidence of adverse events and the
likely high cost that the immunotherapy
combination will command could constrain
its uptake. Pembrolizumab (MK‑3475;
Merck), another anti-PD1 therapy, is also
in Phase III development. It was awarded
FDA breakthrough designation and has
been undergoing a rolling review for patients
with unresectable or metastatic malignant
melanoma who have previously received
ipilimumab. It remains to be determined
which PD1-directed therapy will demonstrate
the highest and most durable response rates1,2.
Other immunotherapeutic approaches
are also being explored. The oncolytic
immunotherapy talimogene laherparepvec
(T‑Vec; Amgen) is a modified version of
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) that is
modified to selectively replicate in tumour
cells and activate a systemic immune response.
In a Phase III study it achieved a durable
response rate of 16% compared with 2% for
patients treated with granulocyte–macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
However, its median overall survival was
not met with statistical significance (23.3
months versus 18.9 months with GM-CSF).
Interestingly, talimogene laherparepvec
is being evaluated in combination with
ipilimumab in a Phase I/II study. Preliminary
data show that the combination achieved
an overall response rate of 41%, with an
impressive complete response rate of 24%.
Ipilimumab is also being tested as adjuvant
treatment after resection of stage III melanoma.

show a recurrence-free survival of 26.1 months
(compared with 17.1 months for placebo).
However, the frequency of grade 3/4 immunerelated adverse events was high with ipilimumab
(42%) and there were treatment-related
deaths (1.1%). The rate of discontinuation
owing to adverse events was also higher with
ipilimumab (48.8%) than with placebo (1.7%).
Market indicators
In 2013, ipilimumab and vemurafenib
achieved US sales of $577 million and
$127 million, respecively. Dabrafenib and
trametinib achieved early strong uptake
in the United States (US$30 million).
Ipilimumab has had a considerable impact
on the malignant melanoma market, and
in 2013 it accounted for nearly two-thirds
of total malignant melanoma therapy
US sales1 (FIG. 1). Additional immune
checkpoint inhibitors, namely nivolumab
and pembrolizumab, are expected to enter
the malignant melanoma market before the
end of 2014. These agents will compete with
ipilimumab, driving a growth in sales of the
immune checkpoint inhibitor drug class.
Vemurafenib dominated BRAF and MEK
inhibitor sales in 2013, but despite nearly half
of malignant melanoma tumours harbouring
BRAF mutations, this drug class contributed
just one-fifth of total US sales in this year1.
We anticipate that the BRAFV600-mutated
segment will become more competitive as
several large companies vie to secure maximum
market share for their products. Considering
that the immune checkpoint inhibitors can be
used to treat patients regardless of mutational
status and have the potential to induce rapid
and durable responses and considerably
prolong survival, BRAF and MEK inhibitors

may be relegated to the smaller, and thus less
lucrative, later-stage disease settings. We also
expect that later-to-market BRAF plus MEK
combination therapies will face challenges in
gaining traction in what will be a crowded and
competitive market.
