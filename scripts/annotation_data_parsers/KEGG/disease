NAME        Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia)
DESCRIPTION Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells, affects both children and adults, with peak prevalence between the ages of 2 and 5 years. ALL arises from recurrent genetic insults that block precursor B and T cell differentiation and drive aberrant cell proliferation and survival. Recurrent defects generate molecular subgroups of B- and T-ALL. B-precursor ALL is the most common form of acute leukemia in children. The t(12;21) translocation that creates the TEL-AML1 fusion gene is the most common genetic lesion in pediatric ALL, occurring in 20-25% of B-lineage cases, but is much less common in adult ALL. Conversely, unlike adult B-ALL, in which t(9;22) is identified in approximately 33% of cases, this translocation encoding the BCR-ABL fusion protein is found in only 5% of childhood cases.

DESCRIPTION Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells, affects both children and adults, with peak prevalence between the ages of 2 and 5 years. ALL arises from recurrent genetic insults that block precursor B and T cell differentiation and drive aberrant cell proliferation and survival. Recurrent defects generate molecular subgroups of B- and T-ALL. T-ALL accounts for approximately 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. The DNA lesions in T-ALL can be grouped into four classes: point mutations providing a self-renewal potential (NOTCH1); mutations and fusions leading to a proliferative and survival advantage; mutations and deletions leading to loss of cell cycle control; and chromosomal translocations resulting in cell differentiation impairment. Most chromosomal translocations in T-ALL patients lead to inappropriate activation of structurally intact cellular proto-oncogenes such as MYC, TAL1, HOX11 or LMO2, but some can produce fusion genes such as MLL-ENL.

ENTRY       H00003                      Disease
NAME        Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
DESCRIPTION Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as AML-ETO, PML-RARalpha or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases,  the transcription factors themselves are mutated.

NAME        Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
DESCRIPTION Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) originates in a pluripotent hematopoetic stem cell of the bone marrow and is characterized by greatly increased numbers of granulocytes in the blood. Myeloid and other hematopoetic cell lineages are involved in the process of clonal proliferation and differentiation. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22.  The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.

NAME        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
DESCRIPTION B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is caused by the abnormal progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. It is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, accounting for about 30% of total leukaemias. Worldwide there are approximately 180,000 new cases every year. A main focus in CLL research involved the evaluation of genetic features related to somatic gene mutation or deletions that disrupt apoptosis and enhance tumor cell proliferation. The best characterized genes are TP53 (also known as p53) and ATM, for which mutations and/or deletions have been described that predict rapid disease progression, resistance to conventional therapies and poor survival.

NAME        Hairy-cell leukemia
DESCRIPTION Hairy cell Leukemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that is defined, according to the WHO classification, as a mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasm. HCL accounts for between 2-3% of all leukemia cases, with about 600 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. With regard to genetic abnormalities of potential pathogenetic importance in HCL, only a few have been described. Mutations of p53 and Bcl-6 have been reported in about one-third of cases, but their functional significance is unclear. Over-expression of cyclin D1, an important cell cycle regulator, has been reported in cases of HCL as well as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and in a few cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia among lymphoid malignancies.

NAME        Hodgkin lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).

NAME        Burkitt lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma consisting of endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated variants. Endemic BL (eBL) affects children and young adults in Africa and some other geographical areas and carries Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in more than 95% of cases. In contrast, sporadic BL (sBL) among adolescents in Europe and North America are mostly EBV-negative. A third type of BL is associated with HIV-infection in adults. All of these subtypes possess chromosomal rearrangements of the c-myc oncogene, the genetic hallmark of BL that contributes to lymphomagenesis through alterations in cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, cellular adhesion, and metabolism. Many BL carry point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or other defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, and inactivation of the p16INK4a gene by promoter methylation or homozygous deletion. This indicates that disruption of both the pRb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways is critical for BL development.

NAME        Adult T-cell leukemia
DESCRIPTION Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies and is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). The HTLV-I Tax protein has been demonstrated to be the oncogenic protein of the virus. Tax may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including upregulating the expression of cellular genes involved in T cell growth and proliferation, including IL-2, IL-2R-alpha, and IL-15. However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression. This finding suggests that epigenetic change, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in the leukemogenesis of ATL.

ENTRY       H00010                      Disease
NAME        Multiple myeloma
DESCRIPTION Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.

ENTRY       H00011                      Disease
NAME        Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma
DESCRIPTION Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype characterized by small B-lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and plasma cells, usually involving bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the spleen. WM can be distinguished clinically from LPL on the basis of a detectable monoclonal (IgM) immunoglobulin spike in serum. In the general population, LPL/WM is a very rare disease, accounting for only 1%-2% of all hematologic malignancies, reflected in an incidence rate of 3-4 cases per million people per year. The t(9;14)(p13;q32) is present in near 50% of cases of LPL. This chromosomal translocation involves a junction between 9p13 and the switch micro region of the Ig heavy chain locus on 14q32. The 9p13 breakpoint contains the PAX-5 gene which encodes a B-cell specific transcription factor involved in the control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. The translocation causes the juxtaposition of the PAX-5 gene to the IgH locus in the opposite direction of transcription, resulting in an 11-fold over-expression of PAX-5 mRNA.

NAME        Polycythemia vera
DESCRIPTION Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an erythroid dominant trilineage proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. PV belongs to the family of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), which includes hematological diseases that share clinical and biological similarities, such as a hematopoietic stem cell origin: PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some types of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), systemic mast cell disease (SMD) and other rare disorders. Recently, a specific point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene was described in a majority of PV patients and thus constitutes a sensitive diagnostic marker for the disease.

NAME        Small cell lung cancer
DESCRIPTION Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases.  Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.

NAME        Non-small cell lung cancer
DESCRIPTION Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, c-erbB-2 and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Overexpression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a  inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector.Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.

ENTRY       H00015                      Disease
NAME        Malignant pleural mesothelioma
DESCRIPTION Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.

NAME        Oral cancer
DESCRIPTION Oral cancer refers to a subgroup of head and neck malignancies that develop at the lips, tongue, salivary glands, gingiva, floor of the mouth, oropharynx, buccal surfaces and other intra-oral locations, according to the International Classification of Diseases. Nevertheless, the term is synonymous to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of oral mucosal origin that accounts for more than 90% of all malignant presentations at the aforementioned anatomical sites. Worldwide, oral SCC (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer; more than 300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. The development of OSCC is a multistep process requiring the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, influenced by a patient's genetic predisposition as well as by environmental influences, including tobacco, alcohol, chronic inflammation, and viral infection. The genetic changes include activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alterations of tumor suppressors p53 and p16, and cyclin D1 overexpression.

NAME        Esophageal cancer
DESCRIPTION Esophageal cancer represents the 9th leading cancer in the world and is associated with a 5-year survival rate under 25%. The two main forms are squamous-cell carcinoma (ECSC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). ECSC is the most frequent histological subtype in esophageal cancer, although the incidence of EAC is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the western world. Whereas ESCC can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the most important risk factor for the development of EAC is duodenal-gastric-esophageal reflux. In the process of tumorigenesis at the cellular level, multiple genetic alterations are involved, including mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of cyclin D1 gene, among others.

NAME        Gastric cancer
DESCRIPTION Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. There is substantial international variation in gastric cancer incidence with the highest rates reported from Korea, Japan and eastern Asia. The global burden of gastric cancer is shifting rapidly from the developed world to the developing world. Despite the worldwide decline in incidence and the major improvements in diagnosis and treatment, less than 20% of patients survive to 5 years. Phenotypically, gastric cancer is divided into two histomorphological entities denominated 'intestinal' (IGCA) and 'diffuse' (DGCA), which differ in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical outcome and genetic profile. The risk of both IGCA and DGCA is increased in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, and the risk rises with increases in grade and extent of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. Mutations and/or amplification/overexpression of the oncogenes c-K-ras, c-erbB-2, K-sam and c-met, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes p53, APC and DCC, and abnormal transcription of CD44 are believed to play a role in gastric carcinogenesis but seem to vary in frequency between IGCA and DGCA. E-cadherin/CDH1 gene germline mutations have been recognized in families with an inherited predisposition to DGCA.

NAME        Pancreatic cancer
DESCRIPTION Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways.  Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.

NAME        Colorectal cancer
DESCRIPTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).

NAME        Renal cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.

NAME        Bladder cancer
DESCRIPTION The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of  E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

NAME        Testicular cancer
DESCRIPTION Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) comprises about 98% of all testicular neoplasms and is thereby the most common malignancy among young males. Overall, three different entities of TGCT can be distinguished: teratomas and yolk sac tumors of newborns and infants, seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of adolescents and young adults, and spermatocytic seminoma of elderly men. Recent studies of TGCTs have suggested that overexpression of cyclin D2 is a very early, possibly the oncogenic, event in GC tumorigenesis.

ENTRY       H00024                      Disease
NAME        Prostate cancer
DESCRIPTION Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.

NAME        Penile cancer
DESCRIPTION Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These alterations have been described in both HPV-positive and -negative penile cancers.

NAME        Endometrial Cancer
DESCRIPTION Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the developed world after breast, colorectal and lung cancer. Two types of endometrial carcinoma are distinguished with respect to biology and clinical course. Type-I carcinoma is related to hyperestrogenism by association with endometrial hyperplasia, frequent expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and younger age, whereas type-II carcinoma is unrelated to estrogen, associated with atrophic endometrium, frequent lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and older age. The morphologic differences in these cancers are mirrored in their molecular genetic profile with type I showing defects in DNA-mismatch repair and mutations in PTEN, K-ras, and beta-catenin, and type II showing aneuploidy, p53 mutations, and her2/neu amplification.

NAME        Ovarian cancer
DESCRIPTION Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women in developed countries. Approximately 90% of human ovarian cancer arises within the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), with the rest originating from granulosa cells or, rarely, stroma or germ cells. Ovarian epithelial tumors are divided into mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell subtypes. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers arise in women who have inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). The vast majority of ovarian cancers are sporadic, resulting from the accumulation of genetic damage over a lifetime. Several specific genes involved in ovarian carcinogenesis have been identified, including the p53 tumor suppressor gene and ERBB2 and PIK3CA oncogenes.

NAME        Choriocarcinoma
DESCRIPTION Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant epithelial tumor that can be associated with any type of gestational event, most often a complete hydatidiform mole (CM). CM occur in about one per 1000 pregnancies, and about 5-20% of CM progress to invasive moles or choriocarcinoma. Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma. Moreover, choriocarcinomas have been shown to express increased concentrations of MMP and decreased concentrations of TIMP to help with tumor invasion and metastasis.

ENTRY       H00029                      Disease
NAME        Vulvar cancer
DESCRIPTION Vulvar cancer is a relatively uncommon malignancy, occurring at a rate of 2.2 per 100,000 women per year. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vulvar cancer and is observed in 80% to 90% of cases. There are at least two quite different types of SCC of the vulva. The less common, accounting for about one-third of cases, occurs in relatively young women, is usually preceded by the undifferentiated form of vulvar squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the more frequent form develops in elderly patients, is not commonly associated with undifferentiated VIN but is frequently associated with differentiated VIN, lichen sclerosus or squamous hyperplasia, and is generally not linked to HPV infection. Relatively little is known about molecular changes in the genesis of vulvar cancer. Some studies suggest that early p53 mutation may be a defining step only in HPV-negative tumors. A rather small study suggests that mutation in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is an early change in a substantial subset of vulvar carcinomas.

NAME        Cervical cancer
DESCRIPTION Cervical cancer is the second largest cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, and it occurs following persistent infection, sometimes for decades, with a specific subset of human papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly types 16, 18, 33 and 42. Experimental studies show that the E6 and E7 genes of these high risk HPVs are oncogenes that deregulate key cell cycle controls. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins bind respectively to the p53 and Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, which are involved in the regulation of growth control. The abnormalities in other cellular genes found in cervical cancer, including mutations in ras family of genes, and amplification in EGFR and ERBB2, may also play an important role in carcinogenesis and the aggressiveness of cervical tumors, although to date the role of most of these genetic abnormalities does not appear to be as important as the role of HPV.

NAME        Breast cancer
DESCRIPTION Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy in women worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. More than 1-2 million cases are diagnosed every year, affecting 10-12% of the female population and accounting for 500 000 deaths per year worldwide. Approximately 5-10% are thought to be inherited. The hereditary breast cancer syndrome includes genetic alterations in various susceptibility genes such as p53, PTEN, BRCA1, and BRCA2. Sporadic breast cancers result from a serial stepwise accumulation of acquired and uncorrected mutations in somatic genes, without any germline mutation playing a role. Oncogenes that have been reported to play an early role in sporadic breast cancer are MYC, CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and ERBB2 (HER2/neu). In sporadic breast cancer, mutational inactivation of BRCA1/2 is rare. However, non-mutational functional suppression could result from various mechanisms, such as hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter.

NAME        Thyroid cancer
DESCRIPTION Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and accounts for the majority of endocrine cancer- related deaths each year. More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells.  Their behavior varies from the indolent growing, well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas (PTC and FTC, respectively) to the extremely aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma (UC). Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. The most distinctive molecular features of FTC are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR{gamma} rearrangements. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma.

NAME        Adrenal carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy defined by a heterogeneous clinical presentation, dismal prognosis, and lack of effective therapeutic regimens. The incidence of ACC ranges from 0.5 to 2 cases per million people per year, accounting for 0.02% of all reported cancers. Unfortunately, most patients present with metastatic disease which reduces the 5 year survival rate to less than 10%. Oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in adrenal carcinomas include mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and rearrangements of the chromosomal locus 11p15.5 associated with IGF II hyperexpression. Deletions of the ACTH receptor gene have recently been found in undifferentiated adenomas and in aggressive ACCs.

NAME        Carcinoid
DESCRIPTION Carcinoid tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms that nonetheless comprise up to 85% of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal neoplasms. They most frequently occur in the midgut and develop from neuroendocrine cells that are normally and diffusely present in this location. Most carcinoids are sporadic but epidemiological studies report a familial risk. Moreover, carcinoids can occur within the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, a rare familiar tumor syndrome in which mutations in the MEN1 gene are manifested. Recently, it has been shown that a majority (78%) of sporadic carcinoids display loss of heterozygosity for markers around the MEN 1 region, thus suggesting involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic carcinoids.

NAME        Ewing's sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor occurring in children and young adults, and accounts for 10-15% of all primary bone tumors. The annual incidence is approximately 0.6/million total population, and it usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 20 years. Ewing's sarcoma is in 85% of cases associated with the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12), which leads to the formation of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene. In another 10-15% of cases the translocation t(21;12)(22;12) generates the EWSR1-ERG fusion, whereas the remaining 1-5% of cases may harbor one of several possible translocations, each resulting in a fusion gene containing a portion of the EWSR1 gene and a member of the ETS family of transcription factors.

ENTRY       H00036                      Disease
NAME        Osteosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer. Approximately 900 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed each year in the United States. The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors. Alterations of Rb1 and c-myc are also common, and mutations have been reported in p53, p16INK4A, and CDKN2B.

NAME        Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are soft tissue sarcomas that are one of the most common neoplasms in children and adolescents. RMSs are presumed to be associated with the skeletal muscle lineage, although those tumors can be present in organs histologically lacking skeletal muscle, like prostate, urinary bladder or gallbladder. RMS comprises a heterogeneous into two major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.

NAME        Malignant melanoma
DESCRIPTION Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations.  Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways. MITF and TP53 are implicated in further melanoma progression.

NAME        Basal cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Cancer of the skin is the most common cancer in Caucasians and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) account for 90% of all skin cancers. The vast majority of BCC cases are sporadic, though there is a rare familial syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, or Gorlin syndrome) that predisposes to development of BCC. In addition, there is strong epidemiological and genetic evidence that demonstrates UV exposure as a risk factor of prime importance. The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (>50%) in sporadic BCC.

NAME        Squamous cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent tumors and their number is still increasing world- wide. Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. SCC in anogenital regions can be caused by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) strains. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs.

NAME        Kaposi's sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disease occurring in several different clinical-epidemiological forms that, however, share the same histological traits and are all associated with infection by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8; also known as KSHV). Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.

NAME        Glioma
DESCRIPTION Gliomas are the most common of the primary brain tumors and account for more than 40% of all central nervous system neoplasms. Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma).  Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.

NAME        Neuroblastoma
DESCRIPTION Neuroblastoma is a tumor derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common solid tumor in childhood. Approximately one-half of children have localized tumors that can be cured with surgery alone. These favorable tumors are characterized by near-triploid karyotypes with whole chromosome gains. These tumors rarely have structural rearrangements, and they usually express the TrkA neurotrophin receptor. Patients with these tumors are more likely to be less than 1 year of age. The remaining children have widespread metastatic disease or quite large, aggressive, localized tumors. These unfavorable tumors are characterized by structural changes, including deletions of 1p or 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and/or amplification of the MYCN protooncogene. They might also express the TrkB neurotrophin receptor and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These patients are usually older than 1 year of age, and have a poor long-term survival rate of approximately 30%.

NAME        Cancer of the anal canal
DESCRIPTION Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal accounts for 1.5 per cent of all digestive system cancers in the USA, with an estimated 4,660 new cases and 660 deaths in 2006. Epidemiological and molecular-biology studies have now shown that sexually transmitted infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important aetiological agent. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also associated with anal cancer. HPV infection is transient in most immunocompetent individuals, but HIV-positive patients have evidence of persistent HPV infection within the anal canal. Current data suggest that mutations in p53, DCC and APC tumor suppressor genes contribute to the stepwise progression of anal squamous cell carcinoma in immunocompetent individuals.

ENTRY       H00045                      Disease
NAME        Malignant islet cell carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms (PENs), commonly referenced as islet cell tumors, are relatively uncommon tumors. The most common type is of beta-cell origin and is known as insulinoma, which can be either benign or malignant. The majority of insulinomas arise sporadically, but a small proportion develop as part of the hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. MEN1 is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome that occurs due to inactivating mutations of the MEN1 gene locus, coding for a tumor-suppressor protein, menin. About sporadic PENs, limited information regarding underlying genetic and molecular alterations is known. Alterations of the p16 gene, caused by deletion or methylation, have been identified in 42-58% of sporadic PENs, although these findings are controversial and may vary significantly based on PEN subtype.

NAME        Cholangiocarcinoma
DESCRIPTION Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that carries a poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy. It is the second most common primary hepatic tumor, and it is increasing in incidence and carries a high mortality. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree, either within the liver (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: ICC) or more commonly from the extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Several studies have demonstrated mutations resulting in overexpression of K-ras and p53 genes. These genetic alterations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype in this cancer. Many reports have implicated overexpression of the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogenes c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and c-Met, as well as cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

NAME        Gallbladder cancer
DESCRIPTION Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively uncommon neoplasm, however its prognosis is poor with less than a 5% 5-year survival rate. There are considerable geographic differences in its incidence and etiology. Two main pathways of GBC pathogenesis have been identified. The most common is associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, whereas a second, less frequent pathway is associated with a congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction, which is particularly common in Japan. TP53 inactivation has an important and early role in GBC associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation. Although KRAS mutations are rarely detected in GBC associated with gallstones, they are frequent and early events in tumors associated with congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction.

NAME        Hepatocellular carcinoma
DESCRIPTION Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer and one of the rare human neoplasms etiologically linked to viral factors. Chronic infections with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been implicated in about 80% of cases worldwide, and other known environmental risk factors, including alcohol abuse and dietary intake of aflatoxin B1, might synergize with viral infections. Recent studies have discovered genetic and epigenetic changes involved in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, including mutations in Rb1, AXIN1, p53, IGFR-II/M6PR, p16, E-Cadherin, and PTEN. The most frequently mutated genes in HCC include p53 and beta-catenin, although mutation prevalence varies greatly depending on etiology.

NAME        Myxoid liposarcoma
DESCRIPTION Liposarcoma(LS) represents the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of adults and occurs most often in the thigh and retroperitoneum. LSs are subclassified into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic types. The myxoid type, the most common subtype, accounts for approximately 40% to 54% of all liposarcomas. The karyotypic hallmark of myxoid LS is the t(12;16)(q13;p11), present cytogenetically in >90% of the cases. The translocation leads to the fusion of the DDIT3(CHOP) and FUS(TLS) genes at 12q13 and 16p11, respectively, and the generation of a FUS-DDIT3 hybrid protein. In 4 cases of myxoid LS, a variant chromosomal translocation has been described, t(12;22), in which DDIT3 fuses instead with EWSR1(EWS), a gene highly related to TLS.

NAME        Synovial sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Synovial sarcomas account for 7% to 10% of all human soft-tissue sarcomas. The tumors arise at any age, but affect mainly young adults and more commonly males. Clinically, they appear as deep-seated slowly growing masses. In more than half of the cases, metastases develop, primarily to the lungs but also to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. A specific translocation, t(X; 18)(p11.2; q11.2), is found in more than 90% of reported synovial sarcoma, including biphasic, monophasic, and poorly differentiated tumors. The breakpoints of the t(X; 18) have been cloned and shown to involve the fusion of the SYT gene at 18q11 to either of two highly homologous genes at Xp11 called SSX1 and SSX2. The SYT-SSX1 fusion is associated with biphasic morphology and a worse prognosis, whereas the SYT-SSX2 fusion tends to show monophasic morphology and better outcome.

NAME        Alveolar soft part sarcoma
DESCRIPTION Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, histologically distinctive soft-tissue sarcoma typically occurring in children and young adults. Although it displays a relatively indolent clinical course, the ultimate prognosis is poor and is often characterised by late metastases. ASPS is characterised by an unbalanced translocation: der(17)t(X:17)(p11;q25). This translocation causes the fusion of the TEF3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3) with a novel gene at 17q25, named ASPL. Translocation between chromosomes X and 17 is seen in all the tested cases, implicating transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of this tumor.

NAME        Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue
DESCRIPTION Soft tissue sarcomas account for only about 1% of all malignant diseases and there are less than 8,700 new cases per year in the United States. Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a highly malignant tumor of deep soft tissues is perhaps the rarest of these. CCS is characterized by the translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12). This translocation rearranges the ATF1 gene at 12q13 and the EWSR1 gene at 22q12, originating an EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene. Given its specificity, this genetic aberration is considered pathognomonic for CCS and can be used as a diagnostic marker of this neoplasia.

NAME        Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
DESCRIPTION Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a unique, rare soft-tissue tumor with prominent myxoid morphology. The tumor most commonly develops in deep parts of the proximal extremities and limb girdles in middle-aged adults, and there is a predilection for male patients. Currently, a chromosomal translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12) and the resultant fusion gene, EWSR1-NR4A3, has been defined in approximately 75% of EMC. More recently, another fusion gene, TAF15-NR4A3, resulting from t(9;17)(q22;q11.2), has been identified. The abnormal proteins resulting from these fusion genes aberrantly affect gene transcription and cellular signaling pathways thought to be responsible for initiating sarcoma formation.

ENTRY       H00054                      Disease
NAME        Nasopharyngeal cancer
DESCRIPTION Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare disease in most parts of the world, with an age-standardised annual incidence of less than 1 per 100000. However, in Southern China, parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean basin, NPC is an endemic disease with an incidence of 10-30 per 100000. Genome-wide studies have unravelled multiple chromosomal abnormalities with involvement of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Alterations of genes such as Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), p16/INK4A, p14/ARF suggest that multiple cellular pathways were dysregulated in the NPC cells. Studies on the precancerous lesions revealed early genetic changes and a critical role of Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) latent infection in the development of this cancer.

ENTRY       H00055                      Disease
NAME        Laryngeal cancer
DESCRIPTION Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in Europe, with about 52,000 new cases per year, 90% of them occurring in men. Smoke and alcohol represent the major behavioral risk factors. Of all laryngeal cancers, some 95% are squamous cell carcinomas. Some molecular events have been described in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Although tumor suppressor inactivation of p53 and p16 is common in these tumors (about 50% each), oncogenic activation is less well characterized. Cyclin D1 and epidermal growth factor receptor amplification have been reported in one-third and one-quarter of LSCCs, respectively, both related to advanced stages, whereas c-myc could be amplified in 13% of cases although without associated overexpression.

ENTRY       H00056                      Disease
NAME        Alzheimer's disease (AD)
DESCRIPTION Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.

ENTRY       H00057                      Disease
NAME        Parkinson's disease (PD)
DESCRIPTION Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Mutations in alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 (a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), parkin, DJ1 (a parkin-associated protein involved with oxidative stress), and PINK1 (a putative serine threonine kinase) are known to cause early-onset PD. Mutations or altered expression of these proteins contributes to the damage and subsequent loss of DA neurons through common mechanisms that result in proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum. This results in a reduced activation of the direct pathway and in a disinhibition of the indirect pathway, which is associated with the elevation of adenosine A2A receptor transmission. Such unbalanced activity of the striatal output pathway is at the basis of the motor impairment observed in PD.

ENTRY       H00058                      Disease
NAME        Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS);
            Lou Gehrig's disease
DESCRIPTION Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal, degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.

ENTRY       H00059                      Disease
NAME        Huntington's disease (HD)
DESCRIPTION Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF. While mHtt binds to p53 and upregulates levels of nuclear p53 as well as p53 transcriptional activity. Augmented p53 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction.

NAME        Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)
DESCRIPTION Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of the CAG repeat diseases like Huntington's disease. It is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the atrophin 1 gene and shows various combinations of clinical symptoms depending on the age of onset. The clinical features of DRPLA include progressive myoclonus, seizure, and mental retardation in patients with an earlier onset (generally < 20 years) and cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis, and dementia in patients with a later onset (> 40 years).

            Fatal familial insomnia (FFI)
DESCRIPTION Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.

NAME        Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA);
            Kennedy's disease
DESCRIPTION Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy disease, is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakening of the limb and bulbar muscles. It is an X-linked recessive disease that only affects males. SBMA is caused by expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene. The expansion of encoded polyglutamine tracts results in protein aggregation and is associated with neuronal cell death.

NAME        Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA);
            Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3)
DESCRIPTION The dominantly inherited ataxias or spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of progressive disorders which characteraized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, eyes/oculomotor deficits, gait ataxia and dysarthria ataxia.The prevalence of SCAs is estimated to be 1-4/100.000. At least 28 genetic loci for SCAs had been discovered. SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17 are caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode a pure repeat of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein. SCA8, 10 and 12 are due to repeat expansions outside of the protein-coding region of the respective disease genes. SCA5, 13, 14 and 27 are caused by conventional mutations in specific genes: deletion, missense, nonsense and splice site mutations.

DESCRIPTION Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder with a birth frequency of about 1 in 300 000. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with abnormal eye movements and cutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, and premature aging. The product of the causative gene ATM is a 350 kDa protein of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family that is involved in mitogenic signal transduction, intracellular protein transport, and cell cycle control.

NAME        Alexander disease
DESCRIPTION Alexander disease is a rare, but often fatal neurological disorder that has been divided into three subtypes based on the age of onset: the infantile, juvenile and adult forms. The characteristic neuropathological feature of all forms of Alexander's disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers which include protein aggregates that contain glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and small stress proteins in astrocytes.

NAME        Lewy body dementia (LBD);
            Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
DESCRIPTION Lewy Body dementia (LDB) is neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, mild parkinsonism, and fluctuations in attention and alertness. It is the second most-common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive Lewy Bodies is seen in the brainstem, the limbic system or cortical and subcortical regions, depending on disease subtype. The genetic risk factors include alpha-synuclein mutations and SNCA locus triplicationslocus triplications. Mutations of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have also been implicated in familial DLB.

NAME        Friedreich ataxia
DESCRIPTION Friedreich ataxia is one of the most common forms of autosomal recessive ataxia caused by severely reduced levels of frataxin as a result of a large GAA triplet-repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. Frataxin deficiency is thought to cause generation of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species and mitochondrial dysfunction.

NAME        Leber optic atrophy;
            Leber hereditary optic atrophy (LHON)
DESCRIPTION Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally transmitted inherited genetic disease underlying mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It is primarily an ophthalmological disorder, presenting predominantly in young adult males and characterized by acute or subacute bilateral optic atrophy that results in the loss of central vision. In most of the patients with LHON, visual dysfunction is the only manifestation of the disease. The incidence of LHON in Western Europe is 1/30000-1/50000; at least 1 in 14000 males is affected.

            Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (GSD type XI);
            Glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD type 0)
DESCRIPTION Glycogen storage disease (GSD) is an autosomal recessive (all types except IXa and IXd) or X-linked (types IXa and IXd) disorder with symptoms ranging from weakness to growth abnormalities. GSD is caused by a defect in an enzyme gene or a transporter gene involved in glycogen metabolism; types I, VII, and XI for processing of glucose, types II-VI and IX for processing of glycogen, and type 0 for glycogen synthesis. Pompe disease (type II) is a lysosomal storage disease.

            Fructosemia
DESCRIPTION Hereditary fructose intolerance or fructosemia (fructose in the blood) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in an aldolase gene (aldolase B), which is normally expressed in liver and kidney. Aldolase is the enzyme that converts fructose 6P (a six-carbon compound) to glycerone-P and glyceraldehyde-3P (two three-carbon compounds).

ENTRY       H00072                      Disease
NAME        Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, including:
            Leigh syndrome [DS:H01354];
            Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency;
            Pyruvate dehydrogenase E3-binding protein deficiency (PDHXD)
DESCRIPTION Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is an autosomal or X-linked recessive disorder caused by deficient enzyme activity in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in deficiency of acetyl CoA and reduced synthesis of acetylcholine. This deficiency in newborns may lead to brain malformations. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) is an enzyme which regulates the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. It has been reported that the mutations in PDP1 result in severe exercise intolerance and mild developmental delay.

ENTRY       H00074                      Disease
NAME        Canavan disease (CD)
DESCRIPTION Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated with mutations of the gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA). In humans, the CD syndrome is marked by early onset, hydrocephalus, macroencephaly, psychomotor retardation, and spongiform myelin sheath vacuolization with progressive leukodystrophy. The disease is caused by aspartoacylase deficiency resulting in accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The increased levels of NAA in CD lead to swelling or sponginess of the brain. Two mutations account for about 98% of the alleles of Ashkenazi Jewish patients, in which population the disease is highly prevalent(E285A and Y231X in ASPA protein). Mutations in the ASPA gene in non-Jewish patients are different and more diverse.

NAME        Refsum disease;
            Heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis
DESCRIPTION Refsum disease (RD) is an autosomal recessive sensory motor neuropathy charactarized by retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral neuropathy, anosmia, deafness, cerebellar ataxia and elevated protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of an increased number of cells. The age at which symptoms first present in RD can be variable although most cases present in adolescence. Because the patients are unable to metabolize phytanic acid derived from exogenous sources, highly raised plasma phytanic acid (PA) level in tissues and body fluids is the hallmark of RD. Mutant forms of phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (PHYH) which plays a key role of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation in peroxisomes have been shown to be responsible for some, but not all, cases of Refsum's disease. Peroxisomal PHYH import occurs via PEX7 which is the peroxisomal matrix protein receptor. Though PEX7 has been identified another responsible gene, there still remain a small number of patients in whom no mutations in either of these two genes can be found.

NAME        Cockayne syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive multisystem abnormalities such as postnatal growth deficiency, progressive pigmentary retinopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, dental caries and neurological degeneration. CS has thus been classified as a segmental premature-aging syndrome. CSA caused by mutation in the gene encoding the group 8 excision-repair cross-complementing protein (ERCC8) is early childhood onset in the second year of life, CSB caused by mutation in the ERCC6 gene is late childhood onset with mild symptoms. ERCC8 encodes a Walker domain (WD)-repeat protein involved in the transcription-coupled repair system of the actively transcribed DNA. ERCC6 protein is at the interface of transcription and DNA repair and is involved in transcription-coupled and global genome-DNA repair, as well as in general transcription.

NAME        Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP);
            Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome
DESCRIPTION Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressing degenerative disease belonging to the family of tauophaties caused by abnormalities in the microtubule-associated protein, tau. PSP presents with an atypical parkinsonism characterized by progressive axial rigidity, vertical gaze palsy, dysarthria and dysphagia. Although the majority of cases of progressive supranuclear palsy appear to be sporadic, the scarcity of familial cases may lack of recognition of the variable phenotypic expression of PSP. One in every 100,000 Americans over the age of 60 have PSP and patients are usually middle-aged or elderly, and men are affected more often than women.

ENTRY       H00078                      Disease
NAME        Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), including:
            Pick disease of brain;
            Frontotemporal dementia (FTD);
            Ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal dementia (UP-FTD);
            Progressive supranuclear palsy type 1 (PSNP1);
            Inclusion body myopathy with early-onset paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD);
            Frontotemporal dementia, chromosome 3-linked (FTD3)
DESCRIPTION Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a heterogeneous syndrome with the common feature being a relatively selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Multiple genes have been implicated in FTLD including microtubule associate protein tau (MAPT), progranulin (PGRN),Valosin-containing protein (VCP) and chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B). MAPT mutations are associated with tau pathology. Mutations in progranulin and valosin are associated with TDP-43 inclusions. The CHMP2B mutations are associated with ubiquitin-positive pathology.

ENTRY       H00079                      Disease
NAME        Asthma
DESCRIPTION Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.

ENTRY       H00080                      Disease
NAME        Systemic lupus erythematosus
DESCRIPTION Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components, in association with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.

NAME        Hashimoto's thyroiditis
DESCRIPTION Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of immunocytes that replace the parenchyma and induce thyroid enlargement, which eventually leads to gland fibrosis. Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.

NAME        Graves' disease
DESCRIPTION Grave's disease is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by overstimulation of the thyroid gland with agonistic anti-thyrotropin (TSH) receptor autoantibodies. This overstimulation leads to follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing thyroid enlargement, as well as increases in thyroid hormone production and the fraction of triiodothyronine (T3) relative to thyroxine (T4) in thyroid secretion. Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.

NAME        Allograft rejection
DESCRIPTION Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.

NAME        Graft-versus-host disease
DESCRIPTION Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where immunocompetent donor T cells attack the genetically disparate host cells. GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. During step 3, the effector phase, activated CTL and NK cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through Fas-Fas ligand interactions and perforin-granzyme B.

ENTRY       H00085                      Disease
NAME        Agammaglobulinemias, including the following six diseases:
            X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, XLA);
            IgM heavy chain gene deletions;
            Ig-alpha defect;
            Autosomal recessive agammaglobulinaemia;
            B cell-linker protein (BLNK) deficiency;
            Leucine-rich repeat-containing 8
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (a) consists of agammaglobulinaemias. Defects in early B cell development are characterized by the onset of recurrent bacterial infections in the first 5 years of life, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, markedly reduced or absent B cells in the peripheral circulation, and (in the bone marrow) a severe block in B cell differentiation before the production of surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells. Mutations in Btk, the gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), account for approximately 85% of affected patients. Approximately half of the remaining patients have mutations in genes encoding components of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) or BCR, including mu heavy chain (IGHM); the signal transduction molecules Ig-alpha (CD79A) and Ig-beta (CD79B); and lambda 5 (IGLL1), which forms the surrogate light chain with Vpre-B. A small number of patients with defects in BLNK, a scaffold protein that assembles signal transduction molecules activated by cross-linking of the BCR, have been reported.

ENTRY       H00086                      Disease
NAME        Hyper IgM syndromes, autosomal recessive type, including the following three diseases:
            Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICD) defect;
            Uracil nucleotide glycoside glycosylase (UNG) defect;
            Immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM type 3
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (b), hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM), represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. Seventy per cent of the cases are X-linked in inheritance, and others are autosomal recessive. In the autosomal recessive hyper IgM syndromes, the problem lies in the nucleotide-editing enzymes AICD or UNG. These enzymes are only present in the germinal center B cells, and defects in either disrupt B-cell development and antibody production. Patients with these syndromes typically have recurrent bacterial infections and often have lymphoid hyperplasia.

ENTRY       H00087                      Disease
NAME        Other humoral immunodeficiencies, including the following three diseases:
            Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies (ICF)-syndrome;
            kappa light-chain deficiency;
            Ig heavy chain gene deletions
DESCRIPTION Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomaly syndrome (ICF syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome associated with mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3B gene (DNMT3B) in 75% of cases. Patients have variable hypogammaglobulinemia but typically have profound reduction or absence of two or more Ig isotypes. This leads to severe immunodeficiency and death due to infection often before adulthood. Deficiencies of B-cell receptors are caused by mutations in the genes that encode immunoglobulin heavy or light chains or their associated signaling molecules, leading to agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (such as gamma1, 2, 3, or 4; alpha1 or 2; and epsilon) cause deficiencies of individual classes or subclasses of immunoglobulins, but circulating B cells are present and overall antibody function is usually normal. Mutations in the kappa light-chain gene result in a population of immunoglobulin molecules with only lambda light chains instead of the usual mixture of kappa and lambda types.

ENTRY       H00088                      Disease
NAME        Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), including the following four diseases:
            Inducible T Cell costimulator (ICOS) defect;
            TACI defect;
            CD19 defect;
            BAFFR defect;
            CD20 defect;
            CD81 defect
DESCRIPTION There are three major categories of antibody deficiencies: (a) defects in early B cell development, (b) hyper-IgM syndromes (also called class switch recombination defects), and (c) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Category (c) CVID, also called acquired hypogammaglobulinemia, adult-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, or dysgammaglobulinemia, is a heterogeneous group of disorders involving both B-cell and T-cell immune function, the predominant manifestation of which is hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, decreased serum Ig levels, and abnormal antibody responses. The mutated genes that produce the CVID phenotype are known only for a minority of patients, and they are diverse in their influence on immune function. Homozygous mutations in ICOS are clearly the cause of disease. Heterozygous mutations in the TNF receptor family member TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor) can be found in up to 10% of patients with CVID.

ENTRY       H00089                      Disease
NAME        IFN-gamma/IL-12 axis, including the following five diseases:
            IL-12 p40 subunit deficiency;
            IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) beta1 chain deficiency;
            IFN-gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) alpha chain deficiency;
            IFN-gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) beta chain deficiency;
            STAT-1 deficiency
DESCRIPTION The interferon-gamma-interleukin-12 axis is critical for defense against intracellular microbes such as mycobacteria, salmonella, and listeria. Mutations in either chain of the IFN-gammaR lead to severe susceptibility to mycobacteria and are very difficult to treat. Mutations in IL-12p40 or IL-12R beta 1 are milder clinically and can be treated with IFN-gamma because that receptor is still intact. Complete recessive mutations in STAT1 are more severe than any of the others because they affect both IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha signaling.

NAME        NK cell defects, including the following disease:
            CD16 deficiency
DESCRIPTION A patient with a mutation in CD16, also known as FcgRIIIa, has been identified. He was a 3-year-old boy, and suffered from recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth. CD16 is part of the FcgRIII found on NK cells as well as macrophages and some T cells. The receptor allows NK cells to phagocytose organisms or cells coated with IgG in the absence of MHC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). The mutation disrupts NK cell function and is associated with NK cytopenia. The patient also had severe clinical problems after BCG vaccination.

ENTRY       H00091                      Disease
NAME        T-B+Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), including the following eight diseases:
            X-linked SCID;
            Janus kinase-3 (Jak3) deficiency;
            IL-7 receptor alpha (IL7R alpha) deficiency;
            IL-2 receptor alpha (IL2R alpha) deficiency;
            CD45 deficiency;
            CD3 deficiency;
            Winged Helix Nude (WHN) deficiency;
            Immunodeficiency with thynoma
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. SCIDs with lack of circulating T cells but a normal number of B cells accounts for 30 to 50% of all cases of human SCIDs. The most frequent form of SCID, X-linked SCID (SCID-X1), is caused by mutations in the gamma-chain-encoding gene. Gamma-chain is a common subunit shared by several cytokine receptors. It results in an absence of both mature T lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes. The second most common variant is autosomal recessive and due to mutations of the JAK3 gene. IL-7R alpha gene mutations result in a pure T-cell deficiency. Rare cases of SCID consisting of pure T-cell deficiencies have been attributed to defects in key proteins involved in pre-TCR/TCR signaling. Deficiency in the CD45 phosphatase has been reported in two cases of SCID, while defects in CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon and CD zeta have also been described.

ENTRY       H00092                      Disease
NAME        T-B-Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), including the following four diseases:
            Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency;
            Recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficiencies;
            Artemis deficiency;
            Reticular dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency accounts for about half of the autosomal recessive forms of SCIDs. It is one of the most severe immunodeficiencies and is associated with severe depletion of B cells, T cells, and NK cells. V(D)J- recombination deficiency caused by defects in recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2 and Artemis (DCLRE1C) leads to a T-B-SCID phenotype that is characterized by an arrest of B- and T-cell maturation at the stage of pro-B and pre-T cells, respectively, whereas natural killer (NK)-cell maturation is not affected. V(D)J recombination generates the diversity of B- and T-cell primary immune repertoires.

ENTRY       H00093                      Disease
NAME        Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs), including the following nine diseases:
            X-linked hyper IgM syndrome;
            X-linked, moderate;
            CD40 deficiency hyper IgM syndrome;
            Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency;
            RAG deficiency with granulomas;
            Omenn syndrome;
            MHC deficiency (HLA-class I);
            MHC deficiency (HLA-class II);
            Zap-70 deficiency;
            Ca2+ channel deficiency;
            p56 Lck deficiency;
            CD8 deficiency
DESCRIPTION The term combined immunodeficiency (CID) is used to distinguish patients with low, but not absent, T-cell function from those with severe CID (SCID) characterized by profound deficiencies of T- and B-cell (and sometimes NK- cell) function. Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression. ZAP-70 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recurrent and opportunistic infections occur within the first year of life. The mutations in genes responsible for CRAC channel function, ORAI1 and STIM1, cause the defect in Ca2+ influx.

ENTRY       H00094                      Disease
NAME        Immunodeficiency associated with DNA repair defects, including the following six diseases:
            Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [DS:H00064];
            Ataxia-talangiectasia-like syndrome;
            Nijmegen syndrome [DS:H01344];
            DNA ligase I deficiency;
            DNA ligase IV deficiency;
            Bloom syndrome [DS:H01346]
DESCRIPTION A number of genetically determined disorders collectively called as the chromosome breakage syndromes or DNA-repair disorders have a characteristic cytogenetic feature, chromosome instability. They are all autosomal recessive, show an increased tendency for chromosomal aberrations and to develop malignancies. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the BLM helicase, which seems to play a role in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby promoting chromosome stability. A point mutational change in DNA ligase I was identified in a unique immunodeficient individual who suffered recurrent sinopulmonary infection leading to bronchiectasis. A non-inactivating mutational change in DNA ligase IV has also been identified in a leukaemia patient, who was dramatically over-sensitive to radiotherapy.

ENTRY       H00095                      Disease
NAME        Ectodermal dysplasia associated immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), including the following two diseases:
            NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) defect;
            Inhibitor of kappa-B (I-kappa-B) defect
DESCRIPTION Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) refers to a group of inherited disorders involving absence or dysplasia of the ectodermal appendages. Clinically, it is characterized by absence, abnormality, or deficient function of ectodermal derivatives, including skin, teeth, hair, eccrine glands, or nails. In the hypohidrotic/ anhidrotic form of ED (HED/EDA) the patient has no sweat glands, sparse scalp hair and rare conical teeth. Patients with EDA and immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) present some or all of these features, together with severe infectious diseases. EDA-ID principally affects boys, suggesting X-linked recessive inheritance (XL-EDA-ID). This was confirmed in 2000 and beyond with the identification of disease-causing hypomorphic mutations in NEMO, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes IKK-gamma. A novel autosomal dominant of EDA-ID, recently identified in one child, was found to be caused by a hypermorphic mutation of the gene encoding I{kappa}B{alpha}. Similar to XL-EDA-ID patients, from the age of two months he suffered from multiple and severe infections with several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, leading to chronic bronchopneumonitis and gastroenteritis, with failure to thrive.

ENTRY       H00096                      Disease
NAME        Defects of toll-like receptor signaling, including the following disease:
            Il-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Human interleukin (IL) 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) deficiency is a recently discovered primary immunodeficiency that impairs Toll/IL-1R immunity, except for the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3- and TLR4-interferon (IFN)-a/b pathways. IRAK-4 is a kinase that plays a crucial role downstream of individual TLR and IL-1R receptors and upstream of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6). Patients with IRAK-4 deficiency thus fail to produce TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in response to IL-1beta and IL-18, respectively. Their blood cells also fail to produce IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with known TLR agonists. Despite the broad impairment at the two subsequent levels of onset (TLR) and propagation (IL-1R) of inflammation, the clinical phenotype of IRAK-4 deficiency is relatively mild. Patients present no developmental defect and a restricted spectrum of infectious diseases, mostly caused by pyogenic encapsulated bacteria, principally, but not exclusively Gram-positive.

NAME        Chemokine receptor defect, including the following disease:
            WHIM syndrome
DESCRIPTION WHIM (an acronym for warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis, a form of neutropenia) syndrome is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Affected individuals have mutations that variably truncate the cytoplasmic tail domain of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Leukocytes expressing truncated CXCR4 display enhanced responses to the receptor ligand CXCL12, including chemotaxis, which likely impair their trafficking and contribute to the immunohematologic clinical manifestations of the syndrome.

ENTRY       H00098                      Disease
NAME        Chronic granulomatous disease, including the following four diseases:
            X-linked CGD (gp91 phox CGD);
            p22phox deficiency (p22phox CGD);
            p47phox deficiency (p47phox CGD);
            p67phox deficiency (p67phox CGD)
DESCRIPTION Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by impaired activation of the NADPH oxidase activity in phagocytic cells, resulting in the inability of these cells to generate toxic oxygen radicals and hence to kill catalase-positive bacteria. The NADPH oxidase is composed of four polypeptide subunits and mutations in the corresponding genes (gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox) are responsible for the four different genetic subgroups of CGD. Most cases (65%) involve mutations in gp91phox and are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The remainder are autosomal recessive (AR).

ENTRY       H00099                      Disease
NAME        Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), including the following four diseases:
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (I);
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (II);
            Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (III);
            LAD with Rac2 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which neutrophils fail to mobilize and migrate to sites of injury. At least three genetically distinct forms of this group of disorders have been described: LAD I, II, and III. Defects in the expression of beta2-integrins and fucose- containing proteins account for LAD-I and LAD-II, respectively. In LAD-III integrin expression by leukocytes is normal, but the integrins fail to generate high avidity for their cognate endothelial-cell ligands. Mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3), a gene that encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with cytoplasmic tails of beta-integrins in hematopoietic cells, is the cause of LAD-III. Dominant-negative mutations resulting in deficiency of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac2), the predominant hematopoeitic-specific Rho GTPase in neutrophils also leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

ENTRY       H00100                      Disease
NAME        Neutropenic disorders, including the following three diseases:
            Kostmann syndrome;
            Cyclic neutropenia;
            X-linked neutropenia/myelodysplasia
DESCRIPTION Neutropenias represent a series of potentially life-threatening disorders characterised by a reduction in circulating neutrophils. Since neutrophils play a major role in host defense against bacteria, neutropenia patients suffer from frequent episodes of opportunistic bacterial infections. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare neutropenia with a bone marrow maturation arrest of granulocytic differentiation. Kostmann syndrome is an autosomal recessive SCN. The characteristic maturation arrest and the lack of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with Kostmann syndrome can be explained by the deletion of an anti-apoptotic factor (HAX-1) in myeloid cells of these patients. Heterozygous mutations in the protooncogene growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) gene are also associated with SCN. In patients with autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia (CyN), a condition with oscillating neutrophil counts but less severe clinical symptoms, heterozygous mutations in ELA-2/ELANE were discovered. Patients with X-linked severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) have been reported with activating mutations in WASp leading to a constitutively-active form of the protein, and unregulated actin polymerization.

NAME        Other phagocyte defects, including the following eight diseases:
            Chediak-Higashi syndrome;
            Griscelli syndrome, type 1 (GS1);
            Griscelli syndrome, type 2 (GS2);
            Griscelli syndrome, type 3 (GS3);
            beta-actin deficiency;
            Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency;
            Myeloperoxidase deficiency;
            Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency;
            Shwachman syndrome
DESCRIPTION Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial skin and ocular albinism, increased susceptibility to infections, and progressive neuropathy. Clinical reports of CHS have identified mutations throughout the CHS1/LYST gene. Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the myosin VA (GS1), RAB27A (GS2) or melanophilin (GS3) genes. GS is characterized by partial albinism, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurological deterioration, hypogammaglobulinemia and pancytopenia. Abnormal-beta-actin disease accompanies neutrophil chemotactic dysfunction. Neutrophil specific granule deficiency is a rare disorder of neutrophil function characterized by a lack of neutrophil secondary granule proteins and associated with recurrent bacterial infections. It has been linked to a defect in the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) epsilon. Myeloperoxidase deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of neutrophils. Heterogeneous mutations in the gene encoding myeloperoxidase have been described. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a X-chromosomally transmitted disorder. The most frequent clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency are neonatal jaundice, and acute haemolytic anaemia, which is usually triggered by an exogenous agent. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal-recessive, multisystem disease characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired hematopoiesis, and leukemia predisposition. The only gene known to be associated with SDS is SBDS, which encodes a ribosome maturation protein.

ENTRY       H00102                      Disease
NAME        Classic complement pathway component defects, including the following eight diseases:
            C1q alpha-chain deficiency;
            C1q beta-chain deficiency;
            C1q gamma-chain deficiency;
            C1r deficiency;
            C1s deficiency;
            C2 deficiency;
            C3 deficiency;
            C4 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Complement disorders account for only 2 percent of all primary immunodeficiency disorders. They result from the disruption of one of the proteins involved in the classic or nonclassic activation pathways of the complement response. Defects in the classic pathway account for the more common type of complement deficiency, and are associated with increased risk to develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and SLE-like diseases. Homozygous C2 deficiency, which is the most frequent hereditary deficiency in complement classical pathway components, is associated with SLE in 10% of the cases. Complete C1q and C4 deficiencies are less frequent but associated with a higher prevalence of SLE.

ENTRY       H00103                      Disease
NAME        Late complement pathway defects, including the following seven diseases:
            C5 deficiency;
            C6 deficiency;
            C7 deficiency;
            C8 alpha-chain deficiency;
            C8 beta-chain deficiency;
            C8 gamma-chain deficiency;
            C9 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Late complement component (the final common pathway C5b-C9 components) deficiencies are all inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In all cases, homozygous recessive patients have greatly reduced levels of the respective complement component. Generally, patients with deficiencies of C5, C6, C7, or C8 are particularly susceptible to systemic infections with Neisseria meningitidies and N. gonorrhoeae. Infections are rarely fulminant but are often recurrent and frequently involve unusual serotypes of the organism.

ENTRY       H00104                      Disease
NAME        Alternative complement pathway component defects, including the following four diseases:
            Factor B deficiency;
            Factor D deficiency;
            Factor H deficiency;
            Properdin deficiency
DESCRIPTION The alternative pathway is antibody independent and relies on native C3 undergoing minimal spontaneous hydrolysis. Hydrolyzed C3 binds factor B. Factor B, when bound to hydrolyzed C3, is cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. Hydrolyzed C3Bb is responsible for a constant low level of C3 cleavage into C3b. If C3b binds to an appropriate surface, factor B will bind with C3b to form C3bBb, a highly efficient C3-cleaving enzyme. This overall series of successive proteolytic steps is enhanced by the serum protein properdin, which stabilizes protein:protein interactions during the process. Factor H is essential in controlling the function of the alternative pathway by inhibiting the formation of and degrading C3bBb. Deficiencies of alternative pathway-specific components are rare, and usually lead to an increased frequency of Neisseria infections.

ENTRY       H00105                      Disease
NAME        Mannose-binding lectin pathway component defects, including the following two diseases:
            Mannose-binding lectin deficiency;
            Mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) 2 deficiency
DESCRIPTION There is an increasing number of clinical studies indicating that deficiency of the lectin pathway has been associated with an increased risk, severity, and frequency of infections but also autoimmune disorders. MBL deficiency is one of the most common human immunodeficiencies and arises primarily from three single point mutations in exon 1 of the MBL-2 gene. These mutations result in a failure to assemble fully functional multimeric protein. Inherited MASP-2 deficiency has been described as the result of a mutation causing the exchange of aspartic acid with a glycine at position 105, a position in the first domain, CUB1, involved in calcium binding. This mutation abolishes the binding to MBL and ficolins, and deprives MASP-2 of functional activity.

ENTRY       H00106                      Disease
NAME        Complement regulatory protein defects, including the following six diseases:
            C1 inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema);
            C4 binding protein alpha deficiency;
            C4 binding protein beta deficiency;
            Factor I deficiency;
            Decay-accelerating factor (CD55) deficiency;
            CD59 deficiency
DESCRIPTION To prevent undesirable complement activation, host tissues express a number of complement regulatory proteins. They include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, also termed SERPING1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor I, decay accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and so on. C1-INH (SERPING1) deficiency can be genetic or acquired, and this causes an episodic, local increase in vascular permeability in the subcutaneous and submucosal layers, identified as angioedema (hereditary or acquired). Genetic deficiency of C4BP has only been reported in one individual who developed an illness with similarities to Behcet's syndrome. Heterozygous mutations within the Factor I gene have been recently identified in individuals with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), while homozygous deficiency of Factor I is an unusual feature. Factor I-deficient patients present high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and meningitis. Kidney impairment and autoimmune disorders have also been observed. Only a single case of CD59 deficiency has been reported and this individual developed a paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria(PNH)-like illness. In contrast, deficiency of DAF is not associated with haemolytic anaemia.

ENTRY       H00107                      Disease
NAME        Other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes, including the following eight diseases:
            Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome;
            DiGeorge syndrome;
            Hyper-IgE syndrome;
            X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome;
            Lymphoproliferative syndrome, EBV-associated, autosomal, 1;
            Immunodeficiency, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked Syndrome (IPEX);
            Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia;
            Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED)
DESCRIPTION Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disease and characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia. Several nonsense and missense mutations as well as deletions and insertions of the WAS gene have been identified in WAS patients. DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS) is a congenital immune disorder characterized by lack of embryonic development or underdevelopment of the thymus and surrounding organs. The DGS is a member of a group of disorders that have in common a chromosome deletion involving 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by atopic dermatitis associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria. Dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem form of HIES, whereas a null mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene causes an autosomal recessive HIES associated with viral and mycobacterial infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, with manifestations ranging from fatal infectious mononucleosis to B cell lymphomas and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as well as in a distinct gene, SLAM-associated protein (SAP/DSP1/SH2D1A) have been identified in patients with XLP. Recently, it has been shown that a homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) gene is associated with fatal Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferation, with a clinical picture similar to that seen in XLP. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) are examples of dysregulated immunity resulting in a disturbed tolerance and multiple autoimmune phenomena. IPEX is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene, and APECED results from mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH) is due to either the homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the nuclear encoded, non-coding RNA gene RMRP.

DESCRIPTION Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with clinical features of various autoimmune manifestations that predominantly involve polyclonal accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes with lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, and expansion of double-negative (DN) T cells in the peripheral blood. Central to the cellular pathogenesis is defective FAS-induced apoptosis, which in turn leads to dysregulation of lymphocyte homeostasis. ALPS caused by heterozygous mutations in the Fas gene (ALPS Type Ia) make up the majority of identified cases. However, other mutations, namely of the FasL gene (ALPS Type Ib) and the caspase 8 and 10 gene (ALPS Type II) are occasionally detected, whereas some patients do not present any known mutations (ALPS-III). Recently, mutations of the NRAS gene have been suggested to cause ALPS Type IV.

ENTRY       H00109                      Disease
NAME        Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHPL), including the following three diseases:
            Perforin deficiency;
            Munc deficiency;
            STX11 deficiency
DESCRIPTION Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with uncontrolled activation of T cells and macrophages (hemophagocytic activation) that infiltrate into liver, spleen, bone marrow, and CNS. The symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenia. Homozygous and heterozygous gene mutations of perforin, the major immune cytotoxic protein, were detected with frequency between 15% and 50% of all FHPL patients. UNC13D is the second gene associated with FHPL. The encoded protein (Munc13-4) is important for cytolytic granule exocytosis. Recently a third FHPL associated gene on chromosome 6q24 with mutations in STX11 was identified. The encoded protein, t-SNARE syntaxin 11, also plays a role in intracellular trafficking, but its precise role is not known.

ENTRY       H00110                      Disease
NAME        Cholera
DESCRIPTION Cholera is a clinical-epidemiologic syndrome caused by the infection of O1 and O139 serogroups of Vibrio cholerae, a Gram-negative bacillus with the ability to produce a potent enterotoxin (cholera toxin) responsible for the lethal symptoms of the disease. Serogroup O1 causes over 98% of cases worldwide. In its severe form, it is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea and can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Case-fatality rates as high as 50% can be reduced to less than 1% with proper rehydration. Fluid and electrolyte replacement is the mainstay of treatment of cholera patients; the severe cases require antibiotic treatment to reduce the duration of illness and replacement of fluid intake. The antibiotic therapy currently has faced difficulties due to the rapid emergence and spread of multidrug resistant V. cholerae causing several outbreaks in the globe.

NAME        Salmonellosis
DESCRIPTION Salmonellosis (non-typhoid) is an infectious disease caused by any serotype of bacteria in the genus Salmonella, other than Salmonella that causes typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Salmonellosis is one of the most frequently occurring food-borne diseases worldwide, usually acquired via the food chain. Foods prepared with contaminated raw eggs, egg products, and insufficiently heated poultry meat and pork have been identified as the primary sources of human Salmonella infections. Salmonellosis is characterized by the acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and sometimes vomiting. The disease is usually self-limiting, lasting a few days. However, in some cases, more serious complications follow, especially in immunocompromised people, pregnant women, the elderly and children.

NAME        GM2 gangliosidoses, including:
            Tay-Sachs disease (type I);
            Sandhoff disease (type II);
            Tay-Sachs disease AB variant
DESCRIPTION GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiency of beta-hexosaminiase or the noncatalytic GM2 activator in glycosphingolipid catabolism. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons that mainly affects motor and spinocerebellar function. Mutations of the HEXA gene cause deficiency of the beta-hexosaminidase A and result in Tay-Sachs disease. Mutations of the HEXB gene, encoding the beta-subunit, cause deficiency of both enzymes (beta-hexosaminidase A and B), leading to Sandhoff disease. Deficiency of the GM2 activator protein, which mediates the interaction between the water-soluble beta-hexosaminidase A and GM2 ganglioside, causes the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis.

ENTRY       H00125                      Disease
NAME        Fabry disease
DESCRIPTION Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A activity. Symptoms arise because of accumulation of glycosphingolipids -mainly globotriaosylceramide- in multiple organs. Fabry disease affects almost all organs. The most serious complications involve the kidneys, heart, and central nervous system. In contrast to many X-linked diseases, female heterozygotes cannot be considered merely carriers of the mutation. All of the signs and symptoms found in males with Fabry disease also have been reported in females.

DESCRIPTION Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient beta-glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase) activity or saposin C which is an activator of beta-glucocerebrosidase in sphingolipid metabolism. The enzymatic defects lead to the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) in lysosomes of affected cells. Despite the fact that Gaucher Disease consists of a phenotype, with varying degrees of severity, it has been sub-divided in three subtypes according to the presence or absence of neurological involvement. The sub-types are Type 1, 2 and 3.

NAME        Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)
DESCRIPTION Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive demyelinating lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA). The enzyme defect results in the accumulation of sulfatide in the central and peripheral nervous systems and extensive white matter damage and loss of both cognitive and motor functions. Mutated PSAP gene resulting in sphingolipid activator protein B deficiency is known to cause MLD variant in which ARSA is normal.

The enzyme defect results in the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in many organs, as well as elevated metabolite levels in urine. The heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes, ranging from mild-to-severe forms, is a result of different mutations in the IDS gene. This disorder is characterized by mental retardation, coarse faces, short stature, hearing loss, hydrocephalus, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, airway obstruction, and cardiac valve disease.

            Niemann-Pick disease type C2
DESCRIPTION Niemann-Pick disease type C is an autosomal recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder caused by a defect of NPC1 or NPC2 involved in cholesterol trafficking. The disease is characterized by neurodegeneration starting from early life. While NPC1 is a lysosomal transmembrane protein involved in shuttling of substrates to the Golgi and possibly elsewhere in cells, NPC2 is a soluble lysosomal protein known to bind cholesterol.

ENTRY       H00137                      Disease
NAME        Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) typeA and B, including:
            Niemann-Pick disease, type A;
            Niemann-Pick disease, type B
DESCRIPTION Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity, resulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in many organs. ASM plays an important role in normal membrane turnover and is one of the key enzymes responsible for the production of ceramide. Type A NPD is the infantile form characterized by a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to early death. Type B NPD is the later-onset form in which patients exhibit little or no neurological symptoms, but may have severe and progressive visceral organ abnormalities, including hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular disease. The different clinical presentations of Types A and B NPD are likely due to small differences in the amount of residual, functional ASM activity.

NAME        alpha-Mannosidosis
DESCRIPTION Alpha-mannosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of alpha-mannosidase in glycoprotein catabolism. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in many organs. Alpha-mannosidosis is characterized by immune deficiency, facial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing impairment, and mental retardation. The disorder has been described as two distinct phenotypes: a severe form with hepatomegaly and early death following severe infections (type 1) and a mild form with hearing loss and mental retardation (type 2).

DESCRIPTION Mucolipidosis type II (ML II) and mucolipidosis type III (ML III) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase which is multimeric enzyme involved in phosphotransfer of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to lysosomal enzymes (glycoproteins). It is the necessary process for the transport of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins to the lysosomes.

NAME        Mucolipidosis IV
DESCRIPTION Mucolipidosis IV (ML IV) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation and ophthalmologic abnormalities. ML IV is caused by mutations in mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1), a late endosomal/lysosomal ion channel. Cells from patients with MLIV accumulate enlarged vacuolar structures containing phospholipids, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and gangliosides. Accumulation of lipids results from defects in membrane transport along the late endocytic pathway. It was found that MCOLN1 is required for efficient fusion of both late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes.

NAME        Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU)
DESCRIPTION Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase, which is a key enzyme in the catabolism of N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. The enzymatic defect results in inappropriate accumulation of aspartylglucosamines in various organ systems as well as elevated metabolite levels in urine. The main symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria are progressive mental retardation, coarce faces, behavioral, and hepatosplenomegaly.

NAME        Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, including:
            Schindler disease;
            Kanzaki disease
DESCRIPTION Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA) deficiency is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which removes terminal alpha-GalNAc monosaccharides from glycolipids and glycoproteins (primarily O-linked). The enzymatic defect results in inappropriate accumulation of substrates in various organ systems. NAGA deficiency is divided into three types. Type 1 is Schindler disease, characterized by mental retardation, spasticity ,and myoclonus. Type 2, known as Kanzaki disease, is an adult-onset disorder characterized by angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and mild intellectual impairment. Type 3 is an intermediate disorder with mild-to-moderate neurologic manifestations.

NAME        Sialuria/ Sialic acid storage disease, including:
            Infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD);
            Sialuria, Finnish type / Salla disease (SD);
            Sialuria, French type
DESCRIPTION Salla disease (SD) and infantile sialic acid storage disorder (ISSD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in SLC17A5 gene which codes for the protein sialin. Sialin is lysosomal membrane transporter that exports free sialic acid from lysosomes and deficient of sialin results in excessive lysosomal storage of free sialic acid. ISSD has a severe phenotype with infantile onset, while the SD has a milder phenotype with later onset. Both disorders cause developmental delay, and ISSD is generally fatal in early childhood. The differential diagnosis of free sialic acid storage also includes French type sialuria, a disorder due to mutations in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (GNE), the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acid.

NAME        Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, including:
            Wolman disease;
            Cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD)
DESCRIPTION Wolman disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase activity, resulting in massive accumulation of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides. Wolman disease is the infantile form presenting in early infancy with diarrhea, massive hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and calcification of adrenal glands. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only therapy reported to prevent hepatic failure and death, which without treatment occurs within the first year of life. In CESD, hepatomegaly may be the only clinical abnormality, although lipid deposition is widespread.

DESCRIPTION Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a group of severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases characterized by intracellular accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in neurons. NCLs share similar symptoms and signs such as retinopathy, epilepsy, and dementia. Previously, the NCLs were classified into different forms on the basis of age of onset as well as clinical and electron microscopic findings. The presently used nomenclature is based on the genetic findings and divides the NCLs into ten forms, CLN1-CLN10.

NAME        Danon disease;
            X-linked vacuolar cardiomyopathy and myopathy
DESCRIPTION Danon disease is an X-linked disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal-associated membrane protein Lamp2 and resulting in cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and mental retardation. Originally Danon disease was classificatied as a variant of glycogen storage disease II (Pompe disease). However, at present, it is considered that Danon disease is not a glycogen storage disease because the disease is caused by the primary deficiency of a lysosomal membrane protein instead of a glycolytic enzyme and detailed pathological features are different from those of Pompe disease.

ENTRY       H00155                      Disease
NAME        Hypercholesterolemia, including:
            Hypercholesterolemia, autosomal dominant;
            Hyperlipoproteinemia, type IIa;
            Hypercholesterolemia, autosomal recessive (ARH)
DESCRIPTION Familial hypercholesterolaemia is inherited metabolic disease characterized by severely elevated plasma LDL cholesterol, tuberous and tendon xanthomata, and premature atherosclerosis. Patients have a significantly elevated risk of early coronary heart disease. Hyperlipoproteinemia, type IIa is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by deficiency of LDL receptor. Other forms of this disorder include type B hypercholesterolemia caused by mutation of APOB or PCSK9 gene.  Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutations in a LDL receptor adaptor protein.

DESCRIPTION The tyrosinemias are characterized by the accumulation of tyrosine in body fluids and tissues. Type I is the most severe form of tyrosinemia, is caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). This disorder is associated with liver failure, painful neurologic crises, rickets, and hepatocarcinoma. Type II is caused by a deficiency of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), and clinically presents with hyperkeratotic plaques on the hands and soles of the feet and photophobia due to deposition of tyrosine crystals within the cornea. Type III is a rare disorder caused by a deficiency of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, that is associated with ataxia and mild mental retardation.

NAME        Phenylketonuria (PKU);
            Hyperphenylalaninemia, BH4-deficient
DESCRIPTION Phenylketonuria is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism marked by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to a toxic accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and multiple tissues and potentially to intellectual disability, delayed speech, seizures, and behavior abnormalities. Deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of PAH, is caused by defects of the enzymes in pterin biosynthesis. Because BH4 is also a cofactor of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase in neurotransmitter synthesis, BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia is characterized by neurotransmitter deficiencies.

NAME        Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
DESCRIPTION Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by a defect in the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leading to mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. Currently, there are effective therapies that are in use for MSUD; the dietary therapy and thiamin supplementation. The dietary therapy, which involves feeding patients with a synthetic diet containing reduced BCAA contents.

            Schilder-Addison Complex;
            Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER);
            adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)
DESCRIPTION Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutation in the ABCD1 gene that encodes ABCD1/ALDP, a peroxisomal ABC transporter. ALD is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in tissues such as adrenal cortex and white matter of central nervous system. The phenotypes can be subdivided into four main categories: Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Addison-only, and asymptomatic. This disorder is characterized by progressive behavioral, cognitive and neurologic deficit.

ENTRY       H00180                      Disease
NAME        Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin metabolism that results from holocarboxylase synthetase activity disruption. HLCS deficiency is also called multiple carboxylase deficiency, because deficient HLCS activity results in reduced activity of multiple carboxylases. In humans, four carboxylases are known to be biotinylated by HLCS. They are pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Symptoms of HLCS deficiency include metabolic acidosis, a characteristic organic aciduria, lethargy, hypotonia, convulsions, and dermatitis.

NAME        Hyperprolinemia (HP)
DESCRIPTION Hyperprolinemia is a phenotype present in two distinct, autosomal recessive metabolic disorders caused by defects in the l-proline catabolic pathway. Hyperprolinemia type I (HPI) and type II (HPII) are caused by deficiencies in proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH; also known as ALDH4A1), respectively. Patients with HPI may exhibit an increase in plasma proline level in absence of urinary pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) while those with HPII have elevated levels of P5C and proline in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Some patients have neurological, renal, and/or auditory defects.

            Acatalasemia;
            Takahara's disease;
            Hypocatalasemia
DESCRIPTION Acatalasia is an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder caused by deficiency of erythrocyte catalase that metabolizes both hydrogen peroxide and a variety of substrates such as ethanol, methanol, phenol and nitrites. Catalase has an important protective function against the toxic effects of peroxides generated in peroxisomes and removes them with high efficiency. The Japanese, Swiss, and Hungarian types of acatalasemia display differences in biochemical and genetic aspects. Takahara's disease shows progressive oral gangrene and formerly occurred in about half of Japanese acatalasemia patients.

NAME        Peroxisome biogenesis disorder, including:
            Zellweger syndrome (ZS) [DS:H01342];
            Adrenoleukodystrophy, neonatal (NALD) [DS:H00177];
            Infantile Refsum disease (IRD) [DS:H00204];
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1) [DS:H00207]
DESCRIPTION Peroxisome biogenesis disorder (PBD) is a group of lethal disorders caused by mutation of peroxisomal biogenesis factor (PEX) genes. PBDs fall into 4 main phenotypic classes; Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), Infantile Refsum disease (IRD), and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP1). Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form and results in neurological dysfunction, craniofacial abnormalities, eye abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and chondrodysplasia punctata. The patients of NALD and IRD have similar symptoms, but they survive considerably longer than ZS. NALD is the intermediate form and IRD is the mildest form.

NAME        Mevalonate kinase deficiency;
            Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D;
            Mevalonic aciduria
DESCRIPTION Mevalonate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is identified as the cause of two inherited human autoinflammatory disorders: mevalonic aciduria (MVA) and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS). Mevalonate kinase is located at the beginning of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway compromising the biosynthesis of nonsterol isoprenes in addition to cholesterol. Patients of MVA show the symptoms, including dysmorphic features, cataracts, neurologic symptoms. The majority of patients with HIDS experience only recurrent febrile crises, without any neurologic abnormalities or dysmorphic features. Mevalonic kinase activity in HIDS patients is generally in the range of 5-15% of normal as compared to 0-4% in MVA.

NAME        Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, including:
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type I (RCDP1);
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type II (RCDP2);
            Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type III (RCDP3)
DESCRIPTION Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease associated with impaired peroxisomes characterized by proximal limb shortening, severely disturbed endochondrial bone formation, and mental retardation. RCDP1 is peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutation of peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7(PEX7) genes. RCDP2 and RCDP3 are single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies caused by mutation of GNPAT and AGPS. Both of them are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids localized in peroxisomes.

NAME        Cystic fibrosis (CF)
DESCRIPTION Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder of the exocrine glands caused by mutation of CFTR gene which encodes an ABC transporter for salt homeostasis. CF is a common lethal single-gene disorder in Caucasians with an incidence of 1 in 1500 to 1 in 6500, whereas it is rare among Orientals (1:90000). The common clinical features are chronic lung infections, respiratory distress, and pancreatic insufficiency.

The disease is characterized by a chronic haemolytic anaemia with the sickle cells which show abnormal morphology due to the damage of the membrane skeletons and agglutinate under deoxygenated conditions.

DESCRIPTION Familial and congenital polycythemia/erythrocytosis includes a heterogeneous group of disorders with the common characteristic of an absolute increased red cell mass caused by inherited defects in hypoxia sensing. In primary polycythemias there is an innate defect in the hematopoietic progenitors which allows constitutive overproduction whereas in secondary polycythemias normal progenitors are acted on by serum erythropoietin.

NAME        Bartter syndrome
DESCRIPTION Bartter syndrome(BS) is a heterogeneous rare disease unified by autosomal recessive transmission. BS is characterized by impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle with elevated aldosterone excretion resulting in salt wasting, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. Type 1 and 2 are the neonatal type but genetically, clinically, and biochemically different. Type 4A shows Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type 3 is classic Bartter syndrome. Type 5 is characterized by hypocalcemic hypercalciuria with parathyroid hormone suppression.

NAME        Combined proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 3)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 3 RTA is a mixed type that shares the features of both proximal and distal lesions, with impaired proximal bicarbonate reabsorption coupled with an inability to acidify the urine maximally despite severe degrees of systemic acidemia. The condition is due to an inherited deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) caused by a recessive mutation in the CA2 gene on chromosome 8q22.

NAME        Liddle syndrome
DESCRIPTION Liddle syndrome (LS) is a rare form of autosomal dominant hypertension characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, low-renin activity, and suppressed aldosterone secretion. The mutations in the epithelial Na+ channel gene cause failure of the protein endocytosis and accumulation of active channels at the cell surface, leading persistent absorption of Na+ and resulting in large blood volume and high blood pressure.

NAME        Hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 4), including:
            Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I  (PHA1);
            Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Gordon's syndrome)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy. It is also often seen in a number of tubulointerstitial renal diseases. Finally, a great number of drugs may induce hyperkalemic RTA.

            Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH);
            Familial hypercalciuric hypocalcemia
DESCRIPTION The mutations in the CASR gene which expresses in the parathyroid hormone producing chief cells of the parathyroid gland and the cells lining the kidney tubule affect calcium homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in the CASR gene are responsible for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH1) and for neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). FHH1 is caused by homozygous mutations and characterized by benign symptoms with mild hypercalcaemia, whereas NSHPT is caused by homozygous mutations and characterized by more severe ones with severe hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroid bone disease. Gain-of-function mutations are responsible for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) that characterized by seizures in infancy, moderate hypocalcaemia and, absolute hypercalciuria.

NAME        Primary hyperparathyroidism;
            Familial hyperparathyroidism (HRPT)
DESCRIPTION Familial hyperparathyroidism is characterized by parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia with hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone and hypercalcaemia. It is caused by mutation in the HRPT2 (CDC73 or Parafibromin) gene that also causes the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Sporadic cases are also known to occur with somatic mutations within the MEN1 gene.

ENTRY       H00265                      Disease
NAME        Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), including:
            Familial dysautonomia (FD/HSAN3);
            Riley-Day syndrome (HSAN3);
            Congenital pain insensitivity with anhidrosis (CIPA/HSAN4)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), also known as hereditary sensory neuropathies (HSN), are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of low prevalence. They are caused by neuronal atrophy and degeneration, predominantly affecting peripheral sensory and autonomic neurons. Hallmark features are progressive sensory loss, chronic skin ulcers, and other skin abnormalities. Autonomic features vary between different subgroups. Distal muscle weakness and wasting may be present and is sometimes so prominent that it becomes difficult to distinguish HSAN from Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome [DS:H00264].  Many of the causing genes for autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive HSAN  have been identified. These genes have been shown to play roles in lipid metabolism and the regulation of intracellular vesicular transport, but also a presumptive transcriptional regulator, a nerve growth factor receptor, and a nerve growth factor have been described among the causative genes in HSAN. HSAN1 and CMT2B are clinically identical despite being caused by mutations in different genes.

NAME        Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD)
DESCRIPTION Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of sulfatase modifying factor 1 (SUMF1), which posttranslationally activates lysosomal sulfatases by generating formylglycine in their catalytic sites. MSD is known to combine sulfatase deficiency and clinical features of metachromatic leukodystrophy [DS:H00127]. The clinical course ranges from neonatal severe to mild juvenile cases.

NAME        Cystinosis
DESCRIPTION Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal cystine transporter, which leads to intracellular cystine crystals, widespread cellular destruction, renal Fanconi syndrome in infancy, renal glomerular failure in later childhood, and other systemic complications. Since the introduction of cysteamine into the pharmacological management of cystinosis, well-treated adolescent and young adult patients have experienced normal growth and maintenance of renal glomerular function.

EHEC is also referred to as verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) or Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC). The serotype O157:H7 is first associated with human disease after a multistate outbreak in the United States in 1982 involving contaminated hamburgers. The symptoms of EHEC infection range from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and can progress to a severe cases called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

UPEC, the most common etiological agent of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), accounts for >80% of UTI infections worldwide. Once inside the urinary tract, UPEC preferentially colonizes the bladder and causes cystitis, but can also ascend through the ureters into the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis.

NAME        Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection
DESCRIPTION Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection is one of the main causes of infantile diarrhea in developing countries and an important etiologic agent for travelers' diarrhea. ETEC strains colonize the small intestine, secrete enterotoxins, and cause watery diarrhea. The clinical symptoms of ETEC infection can range from mild diarrhea to a severe cholera-like syndrome.

NAME        GM1 gangliosidosis
DESCRIPTION GM1-gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient beta-galactosidase activity. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in nervous tissues and a highly variable storage of keratan sulfate and glycopeptides in visceral and skeletal tissues. There are three main clinical variants, infantile (type I), juvenile (type II), and adult (type III), categorized by severity of symptoms and variable residual enzymatic activity of beta-galactosidase.

NAME        Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), including:
            Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS);
            Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS);
            Chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) all arise from a missense mutation in the CIAS1 gene that encodes NALP3. These are autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes. The pathogenic mechanism of these syndromes is attributed to increased activation of the NALP3 inflammasome, resulting in aberrantly high production of IL-1beta.

DESCRIPTION Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominantly-inherited disease which is presented with triad of juvenile-onset granulomatous arthritis, uveitis, and skin rashes. Inflammation of the eyes, camptodactyly and lymphaedenopathy are additional feature of the disease. Missense mutations in the NOD region of NOD2 underlie Blau syndrome, augmenting NOD2 activity even in the absence of pathogenic stimuli. Inflammation seen in patients with Blau syndrome might be due to an aberrant activation of NOD2 and constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Blau syndrome usually occurs in children younger than age 4 years.

NAME        Crohn's disease
DESCRIPTION Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation, primarily localized to the terminal ileum. Most patients have involvement of the small intestine, but the other area of gastrointestinal tract may also be affected. In Western populations, over 50% of patients possess NOD2 mutations. Evidence exists that the NOD2 polymorphysms impair NF-kappaB activation and cytokine secretion in response to its ligand. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is also attributed to intestinal bacteria that may initiate mucosal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals. Additional genes associated with the disease are recently being identified.

NAME        Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome
DESCRIPTION Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome is a rare autoimflammatory disease with early onset, developing erosive arthritis. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Patients typically develop cystic acne, abscesses and cutaneous ulcers, including pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesions. PAPA syndrome is caused by gain-of function mutations in PSTPIP1, a protein capable of associating with pyrin. Mutated PSTPIP1 reduces the inhibitory role of pyrin on inflammasome activation and therefore, potenciates the IL-1beta pathway. Elevated TNFalpha levels are also described.

NAME        Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF);
            Familial hereditary periodic fever syndromes
DESCRIPTION Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most prevalent hereditary periodic fever, affecting 0.1% in people of Mediterranean descent. It is also reported throughout the world's populations. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by missense mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes the pyrin protein. Mutations in pyrin may lead to uncontrolled inflammation due to IL-1beta hyperactivation. FMF is characterized by recurrent inflammatory fevers with sterile peritonitis, pleuritis, arthritis, myalgia and erysipelas-like skin lesions. Renal amyloidosis is the most severe complication, leads to renal failure. These symptoms start before 20 years of age in about 90% of cases.

NAME        Recurrent hydatidiform moles (RHM);
            Familial biparental hydatidiform
DESCRIPTION Hydatidiform mole is an abnormal human pregnancy composed of hyperproliferative trophoblast occuring in approximately 1 in every 1500 pregnancies in Europe and North America. This incidence is higher in other areas in the world. Recurrent hydatidiform mole (RHM), the familial cases of the disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder in which molar tissues are diploid and have a biparental contribution to their genome. The molar tissues show abnormal epigenetic marking of maternal imprinted genes. Affected women have biallelic mutations in the NLRP7 gene (NALP7), a gene thought to be involved in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.

NAME        Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS)
DESCRIPTION Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal recessive encephalopathy characterized by basal ganglia and white matter calcification in the presence of chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, and a raised level of cerebrospinal fluid IFNalpha. There is progressive neurological dysfunction resulting in a failure of development of expected physical and social skills. AGS presents in infancy and is lethal in ~40% of cases. It can be caused by mutations in the following genes, TREX1, RNaseH2 and SAMHD1 that lead to excessive intracellular accumulation of DNA and abnormal type I IFN metabolism.

            Chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE)
DESCRIPTION Familial chilblain lupus (FCL) is a rare, inherited form of cutaneous lupus with prominent skin manifestations in acral parts of the body. Two families with autosomal dominant-inherited chilblain lupus have been reported. First symptoms manifest in early childhood, developing hypergammaglobulinemia and rheumatoid factor antibody production. In FCL, missense mutations in TREX1 that decrease its exonuclease activity were described. The failure of DNA degradation can result in aberrant immune response.

NAME        Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
DESCRIPTION Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myfibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.

ENTRY       H00293                      Disease
NAME        Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
DESCRIPTION Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.

ENTRY       H00294                      Disease
NAME        Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
DESCRIPTION Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM ("familial" DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of "familial" DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an "idiopathic" DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of "idiopathic" DCM focus on myocarditis induced by enterovirus and subsequent autoimmune myocardium impairments. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with "idiopathic" DCM,  may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2+, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.

ENTRY       H00295                      Disease
NAME        Viral myocarditis
DESCRIPTION Myocarditis is clinically defined as cardiac disease associated with inflammation of the myocardium and necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes in the absence of an ischemic event. Most often, myocarditis results from common viral infections; less commonly, specific forms of myocarditis may result from other pathogens, toxic or hypersensitivity drug reactions, giant-cell myocarditis, or sarcoidosis. More than 20 common viruses, including coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been associated with myocarditis in humans. However, coxsackieviruses are considered the dominant cause of myocarditis, particularly in neonates and young children. After the acute phase caused by direct cytopathic effects of the virus, a small proportion of patients subsequently develop autoimmune- mediated, chronic myocarditis [4], accompanied by circulating autoantibodies to cardiac myosin and other heart antigens, which can sometimes lead to heart failure and death associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Genetic linkage between susceptibility to myocarditis/DCM and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes has been reported in both humans and experimentally induced mouse models.

ENTRY       H00296                      Disease
NAME        Defects in RecQ helicases, including:
            Bloom's syndrome [DS:H01346];
            Werner's syndrome;
            Rothmund-Thomson syndrome;
            RAPADILINO syndrome [DS:H00965]
DESCRIPTION RecQ helicases have crucial roles in the maintenance of genome stability. In humans, it is known that deficiencies in three of the five human RecQ helicases cause genetic disorders characterized by cancer predisposition, premature aging and developmental abnormalities. These disorders are Bloom's syndrome (BS), Werner's syndrome (WS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), which are caused by mutations in BLM, WRN and RECQ4, respectively. Despite the apparent structural and biochemical similarities between the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 proteins, the phenotypes of BS, WS and RTS are different, suggesting that each disease pathway is functionally distinct to some extent. BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination). It was also indicated that BLM is involved in repair of stalled DNA replication forks, and that WRN is required for telomere maintenance.

NAME        Plague
DESCRIPTION Plague is a deadly infectious disease caused by Yersinia pestis. The pathogen has rodent reservoirs and is transmitted to humans usually by fleas as vectors. There are three major manifestations: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plagues. Severe epidemics in the past include the Plague of Justinian in the sixth century, the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and the Third Pandemic that began in Central Asia in the nineteenth century. The genome sequences have been determined for the strains responsible for these epidemics.

NAME        Yersiniosis
DESCRIPTION Yersiniosis (non-plague) is an infectious disease caused by two species, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, which is zoonotic, capable of being transmitted from infected animals to man. Major clinical forms include acute gastroenteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis, which are often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. Routes of transmission include fecal-oral spread via ingestion of contaminated food as the most common route and consumption of contaminated water supplies. Yersiniosis occurs more commonly in regions with temperate rather than tropical or subtropical climates.

NAME        Shigellosis;
            Bacillary dysentery
DESCRIPTION Shigellosis (bacillary dysentery) is a foodborne enterobacterial infection caused by Shigella species. There are four subgroups of Shigella: S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. Of these, S. flexneri is the most frequently observed worldwide, and S. dysenteriae causes severe disease with the highest fatality rate. Clinical symptoms include an acute rectocolitis associated with fever, nausea, anorexia, dehydration, mucopurulent and bloody diarrhea, and tenesmus. Transmission usually occurs via contaminated food and water or through person-to-person contact. In humans, shigellosis can be provoked by an extremely small number of organisms (10-100).

NAME        Klebsiella infection
DESCRIPTION Klebsiella is a gram-negative bacterium of Enterobacteriaceae with multidrug-resistance. They produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes, making themselves resistant to antibiotic drugs. Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause sepsis, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections, and surgical site infections. Bloodstream infections with Klebsiella markedly increase the rates of treatment failure and death.

NAME        Haemophilus influenzae infection
DESCRIPTION Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections are a major cause of severe infections in children between 2 months and 5 years of age worldwide. It affects approximately 25000 patients each year. Severity of the symptoms of Hib infection depends on the patient's age, and infants between 4 months and 1 year of age are at highest risk for meningitis. Invasive disease due to Hib may produce various clinical syndromes including meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia,	 cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and epiglottitis. Mucosal infections, such as bronchitis, sinusitis and conjunctivitis, and otitis media, can also be caused by Hib, but they are considered to be noninvasive disease.

NAME        Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection
DESCRIPTION Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium that naturally inhabits marine and estuarine environments. It is a well-recognized pathogen of both aquatic animals and humans. In the case of humans, it is often acquired through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, causing gastroenteritis with watery diarrhea. Clinical symptoms of V. parahaemolyticus infections include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, fever, and chills.

NAME        Legionellosis;
            Legionnaires disease
DESCRIPTION Legionnaires disease (LD), caused by Gram-negative Legionella spp., can be nosocomial, community acquired or travel related. L. pneumophila is the most common cause of LD. The source of LD is potable water systems that become colonized by the microorganism, transmitted by inhalation of contaminated aerosols and aspiration. Classically, it can cause two different forms of disease in humans: LD, with an incubation period of 2-10 days, which is a multisystem illness that involves the lungs, causing pneumonia, and can cause neurological symptoms, diarrhea and high mortality (up to 50%), and Pontiac fever, with a shorter incubation period of 1-2 days, which is an acute, self-limited, influenza-like disease that does not cause pneumonia. Patients who are at risk for infection include the immunosuppressed, especially those submitted to transplantation (mainly of solid organs), those with chronic lung disease, smokers, and the elderly.

NAME        Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection
DESCRIPTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that may cause severe invasive diseases in critically ill patients. In the 21st century, when the life expectancy of highly susceptible immunocompromised groups has been extended in most countries, P. aeruginosa plays an increasingly prominent role in hospital infections. This organism shows a remarkable capacity to resist antibiotics, either intrinsically (because of constitutive expression of beta-lactamases and efflux pumps, combined with low permeability of the outer-membrane) or following acquisition of resistance genes (e.g., genes for beta-lactamases, or enzymes inactivating aminoglycosides or modifying their target), over-expression of efflux pumps, decreased expression of porins, or mutations in quinolone targets. These mechanisms mediate the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype in P. aeruginosa.

NAME        Melioidosis
DESCRIPTION Melioidosis is an infection caused by the gram-negative soil-dwelling bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei. It predominantly affects people in regular contact with soil and water and is endemic in areas of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. There are many possible disease manifestations including melioidosis septic shock, pneumonia, and hepatic and splenic abscesses. Mortality from melioidosis septic shock remains high.

NAME        Pertussis;
            Whooping cough
DESCRIPTION Pertussis, or whooping cough, caused by the gram-negative bacillus Bordetella pertussis, is a highly contagious, acute respiratory disease of humans. Despite high vaccination rates, this illness has re-emerged worldwide, causing approximately 300 000 deaths each year. Waning immunity after childhood immunization has resulted in a growing pool of susceptible adolescents and adults who are capable of transmitting pertussis to vulnerable unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. The hallmark symptoms of pertussis are paroxysmal coughing with whooping and post-tussive vomiting. Persistent coughing may last for weeks to months with a gradual decrease in frequency and severity. However, it should be noted that B. pertussis infections, particularly in hosts with partial immunity to the bacterium, may also follow a much milder or subclinical course. Complications that are frequently associated with classical pertussis include pneumonia, otitis media, seizures, encephalopathy, and (brain) hemorrhages.

ENTRY       H00320                      Disease
NAME        Helicobacter pylori infection
DESCRIPTION Helicobacter pylori (HP) is a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that specifically colonizes in the gastric epithelium and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastric malignancies. Persistent infection can cause inflammation and gastritis that may lead to carcinogenesis. Transmission is still not entirely clarified, but human-to-human spread through oral-oral or fecal-oral route is thought to be the most plausible. The prevalence of HP infection varies between different geographical regions; generally, the prevalence is about 30% in developed and up to 80% in developing countries. Although HP may sometimes be eradicated by antibiotics given for other infections, infection usually persists life-long unless specific combination antibiotic therapy is taken.

NAME        Brucellosis
DESCRIPTION Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution that mainly affects persons working with domestic animals. Although many countries have eradicated Brucella abortus from cattle, Brucella melitensis remains a major cause of infection in cattle and human in Latin America, the Middle East, Spain, parts of Africa, and western Asia. Consumption of contaminated foods is the sources of infection. The clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic infection to a fever, night sweats and joint manifestations.

DESCRIPTION Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive aerobic-to-facultatively anaerobic bacterium that causes gastrointestinal infections. The organism produces an emetic or diarrheal syndrome induced by an emetic toxin and enterotoxin, respectively. These infections are frequently associated with the consumption of rice-based dishes. B. cereus is also recognized as an infrequent cause of non-gastrointestinal infections such as ocular infections, septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and surgical and traumatic wound infections.

NAME        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (MRSA) infection
DESCRIPTION Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major multidrug-resistant bacteria which have become endemic in the hospital environment, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). Originally limited to the hospital setting, MRSA is a growing cause of infections in the community. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are genetically different from MRSA strains originating in the hospital. Its increase in the community is of concern because CA-MRSA strains appear to be highly virulent, and colonization with CA-MRSA is often undetected in hospitalized patients, which can facilitate its potential for becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics. Health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) is usually associated with pneumonia, urinary tract, blood stream, and surgical wound infections. In contrast, CA-MRSA strains are overwhelmingly associated with skin and soft tissue infections.

NAME        Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (VRSA) infection
DESCRIPTION Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) represents strains of S. aureus that have ability of resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. S. aureus is the most common cause of nosocomial infections. The glycopeptides-notably vancomycin-have traditionally been the mainstay of treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) but overuse has led to the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VISA and VRSA, respectively). Limited treatment options make resistant S. aureus infections particularly difficult and costly to treat, especially in areas of poor antibiotic penetration, such as joint spaces and the central nervous system. A gene known as vanA is a major determinant, which is transferable and can be acquired by sensitive bacteria from resistant organisms.

ENTRY       H00333                      Disease
NAME        Streptococcal infection
DESCRIPTION Streptococci are gram-positive bacteria. The beta-hemolytic streptococci are divided into two groups: group A Streptococcus (GAS) that causes over 600 million cases of infections each year, ranging from mild pharyngitis to severe streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSS), and group B Streptococcus (GBS) that causes neonatal invasive infections including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis.

NAME        Bacterial endocarditis;
            Infective endocarditis
DESCRIPTION Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. The characteristic lesion, a vegetation, is composed of a collection of platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, and inflammatory cells. It most commonly involves heart valves but may also occur at the site of a septal defect, on the chordae tendineae, or on the mural endocardium. Staphylococci and streptococci account for 80% of cases of infective endocarditis, with staphylococci currently the most common pathogens. Cerebral complications are the most frequent and most severe extracardiac complications.

NAME        Foodborne Clostridium perfringens intoxication
DESCRIPTION Clostridium perfringens is a spore-forming, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium consisting of five types (A-E), according to the major toxins they produce. It causes two different foodborne diseases: Type A food poisoning and Type C food poisoning. Type A is a relatively mild diarrhea common in the industrialized countries whereas Type C is a rare but very serious necrotic enteritis.

NAME        Botulism
DESCRIPTION Botulism is an acute neuroparalytic illness caused by a botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium. Botulism occurs in four forms: foodborne, wound, infant botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia. Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in symmetrical, descending, and progressive muscle weakness. Delay in treatment may allow progression of paralysis.

NAME        Vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection
DESCRIPTION Enterococci are gram-positive, facultative bacteria with low intrinsic virulence that constitute the normal colonizing flora of the human gastrointestinal tract. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as major hospital-acquired antimicrobial-resistant pathogens globally, causing bacteremia with or without endocarditis, and intra-abdominal, wound, and genitourinary infection in immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate is high.

NAME        Mycoplasma pneumonia
DESCRIPTION Mycoplasmas represent the smallest self-replicating organisms that are most closely related to the gram-positive bacterial group that includes streptococci, bacilli, and lactobacilli. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a member of the family Mycoplasmataceae that causes lower respiratory tract infection endemically in most areas of the world. Most infections are mild, but small proportion of infected individuals may develop serious pneumonia due to an enhanced host cellular immune response.

NAME        Tuberculosis
DESCRIPTION Tuberculosis is a infectious disease caused by strains of mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulting in an estimated two million deaths each year worldwide, more than from any other single bacterial pathogen. Inhalation is the predominant pathway of infection, making pulmonary tuberculosis the most common form of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis may arise either from a recent infection with M. tuberculosis, or from the reactivation of dormant bacilli, years or decades after initial infection. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mainly results from reactivation of a tuberculous focus after hematogenous dissemination or lymphogenous spread from a primary, usually pulmonary focus.

NAME        Diphtheria
DESCRIPTION Diphtheria is a contagious and potentially life-threatening childhood disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. In industrialized countries, immunization against diphtheria became widespread in the 1940s and the incidence of the disease markedly decreased. However, diphtheria still remains endemic in several regions including Africa, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the tropics, and South America. Moreover, a large proportion of adults in industrialized countries are now susceptible to diphtheria because the protection by vaccine does not last for long time unless periodic booster is given.

DESCRIPTION Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, is still one of the main causes of physical disability worldwide. The new case detection rate remains high, with about 250 000 new cases being registered each year. Infection leads to chronic granulomatous inflammation in skin and peripheral nerves and resulting disability brings about social disadvantage for patients and their family members.

NAME        Nocardiosis
DESCRIPTION Nocardiosis is an uncommon gram-positive bacterial infection that affects mainly patients with deficient cell-mediated immunity. It has been reported worldwide in all ages and ethnic groups. Pulmonary disease is the most common clinical presentation especially in immunocompromised patients, accounting for more than 40% of reported cases. Nocardiosis also occurs in disseminated form, affecting lungs, central nervous system, skin, and the soft tissues. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis typically affects immunocompetent individuals with traumatic inoculation at the infected site.

NAME        Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA);
            Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
DESCRIPTION Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is caused by repeated inhalation of mainly organic antigens by sensitized subjects. This induces a hypersensitivity response in the distal bronchioles and alveoli and subjects may present clinically with a variety of symptoms. EAA is caused by a wide variety of antigens including bacteria, organic materials, fungal spores, and chemicals. Of the various EAA syndromes, Farmer's lung and Bird fancier's disease are the commonest forms that have been studied. EEA is a complex dynamic clinical syndrome where clinical expression depends on the frequency and amount of contact with antigen and host susceptibility. The manifestations and symptoms can be complicated by self-regulatory measures performed by those affected individuals to reduce antigen exposure. There are many individuals with a positive antibody reaction who remain asymptomatic. EEA traditionally has been described as occurring in a state of acute, subacute, and chronic form.

NAME        Chlamydia infection, including the following disease:
            Chlamydial urethritis
DESCRIPTION Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the most common sexually transmissible diseases in the world. Most of these infections are asymptomatic but, if not treated, can lead to non-gonococcal urethritis and post-gonococcal urethritis in men. Urethritis can be complicated by acute epididymitis.

NAME        Trachoma
DESCRIPTION Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Infections with serovars A, B, Ba and C of Chlamydia trachomatis cause chronic keratoconjunctivitis in children with subsequent scarring and blindness in adults. At least 1.3 million people in poor, rural communities in low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa were blind from trachoma in 2002.

DESCRIPTION Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare chronic multi-system disease associated with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei that is ubiquitously present in the environment. The clinical features of WD are non-specific and histological lesions in gastrointestinal system can be the major manifestations. Patients without symptoms of gastrointestinal disease might be insufficiently treated, resulting in a potentially fatal outcome such as endocarditis, neurological infection, osteoarticular infection, or uveitis.

NAME        Leptospirosis
DESCRIPTION Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infection caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. Leptospira infects a variety of animals, being secreted into the environment. Leptospirosis often presents as a self-limiting non-specific febrile event. Asymptomatic infections are common in endemic areas. However, small proportion of the patients may have febrile illness with icterus, splenomegaly and nephritis, febrile illness with pulmonary haemorrhages, or ocular manifestations.

DESCRIPTION Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, affects 20 million people in Latin America and is caused by infection with protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The infection is transmitted by hematophagous reduviid insect vectors through fecal contamination. Chagas disease is characterized by an acute phase followed by a chronic phase, with sustained inflammation that causes cardiomyopathy, digestive disorders, and neuropathies.

NAME        Leishmaniasis
DESCRIPTION Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease that affects more than 10 million people especially in developing countries of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. In humans, leishmanial infections cause self-healing, cutaneous lesions or lethal mucosal and visceral infection (kala azar). There is no defined vaccine available against the disease.

DESCRIPTION Amoebiasis is the infection of gastrointestinal tract that affects approximately 50 million people each year and is responsible for 40 to 100 thousand deaths. People living in Central and South America and Africa are at highest risk of infection. Ingestion of water and food contaminated with Entamoeba histolytica, an extracellular parasitic amoeba causes amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess. Amoebic colitis is characterized by devastating dysentery that usually contains blood. Entamoeba histolytica is a human-specific pathogen.

NAME        Malaria
DESCRIPTION Malaria is the most important threatening infectious disease, infecting approximately 300 million people and causing more than one million deaths in each year. Most severe cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted through the bite of female Anopheline mosquitos. In severe malaria, complications such as anaemia, respiratory distress, renal failure, and cerebral malaria are observed in addition to cyclical fevers.

DESCRIPTION Candidiasis is a fungal infection with Candida species, predominantly with Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, causing bloodstream infections. Recently, various non-C. albicans species have emerged as infecting agents. In patients with impaired IL-17 immunity, recurrent or persistent infections are observed (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease).

NAME        Varicella;
            Chickenpox;
            Herpes zoster;
            Shingles
DESCRIPTION Varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus 3) is an almost inevitable human pathogen that has a double-stranded linear DNA genome. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chickenpox) in children, after which the virus establishes latency in sensory neurons. Subsequent reactivation causes herpes zoster (shingles) in adults. Infiltration of the viral vesicles with inflammatory cells leads to pustule formation, which is followed by ulceration and encrustation in both diseases.

DESCRIPTION Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus of the Herpesviridae family aquired by late childhood in the majority of individuals. Primary infection is nonspecific but after that the virus becomes latent in multiple organs and can later be reactivated. CMV is an important and common cause of mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.

DESCRIPTION Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) are members of beta-herpesvirus that are prevalent in the human population. Like all herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 establish latency in the host following primary infection. Primary infection with HHV-6 can either be asymptomatic, cause roseola with high fever and rash, or be associated with an undifferentiated short febrile illness without rash. Primary infection with HHV-7 is milder and most often asymptomatic, although some cases of roseola-like illness have been linked to it.

NAME        Adenovirus infection, including:
            Viral conjunctivitis [DS:H01320]
DESCRIPTION Adenoviruses (Ads) are recognized as etiologic agents of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, eye, kidney, and, more recently, of other organs as a consequence of solid organ and bone marrow transplantations with their associated immunosuppression. Ads are rarely associated with severe clinical symptoms in healthy individuals. In contrast, in the pediatric population, military recruits, and immunocompromised individuals, Ad infections often result in disseminated and potentially life-threatening disease. Ocular Ad infections are among the leading causes of viral conjunctivitis. There is currently no formally approved antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe Ad keratoconjunctivitis and life-threatening Ad infections in immunocompromised patients.

            Polio
DESCRIPTION Polioviruses are members of the Enterovirus genus that are transmitted via the hand-to-hand-to-mouth contact. Small proportion of poliovirus infections results in paralytic poliomyelitis due to the viral invasion to central nervous system. The virus destroys lower motor neurons, causing an asymmetric paralysis. The loss of motor neurons is permanent.

NAME        Rabies
DESCRIPTION Rabies is an old zoonotic disease which has been known for more than 4300 years. The common mode of transmission of rabies in man is by bite of the animals already suffering from it. Dogs are the major vectors. Rabies affects the central nervous system and causes fatal encephalomyelitis. WHO estimates that over 30 000 people in Asia and at least 24 000 people in Africa die every year due to rabies.

            California encephalitis
DESCRIPTION Mosquito-borne viral encephalitis are infections of the central nervous system with brain involvement that are caused by several members of arboviruses. Japanese encephalitis virus, maintained in pigs, causes severe encephalitis in Asia with an estimated 50 000 cases each year. Its case fatality rate reaches 30%. Other viruses whose reservoirs are mainly birds cause encephalitis only a very low proportion of infected people and there is high proportion of asymptomatic infections.

NAME        Dengue
DESCRIPTION Dengue is a globally important infection that endangers 2.5 billion people in over 100 countries, especially in Southeast and South Asia and Central and South America. Dengue virus infection can cause two forms of illness, dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), depending on host and viral factors. DHF is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by plasma leakage into interstitial spaces, haemorrhagic manifestation, and circulatory shock.

NAME        Yellow fever
DESCRIPTION Yellow fever is an acute hemorrhagic fever with high mortality caused by the yellow fever virus of Flaviviridae. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs only in Africa and Central and South America. Immunization is the most important method of prevention of yellow fever but vaccine-associated adverse events have been reported, including hypersensitivity reactions, neurotropic disease, and viscerotropic disease.

NAME        B virus infection
DESCRIPTION Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, also known as B virus, is an alpha-herpesvirus that naturally infects Asiatic macaques. It is transmitted by exposure to contaminated bodily fluids. In macaques, the infection is similar to that of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in humans and serious disease is rare. However, in humans, it invades the central nervous system and causes serious encephalitis with a fatality rate greater than 70%.

DESCRIPTION Urethritis in men is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Mycoplasma genitalium, that shares several features with M. pneumoniae, has been implicated in non-chlamydial non-gonococcal urethritis. Moreover, it is linked to several inflammatory reproductive tract syndromes in women including cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcome, and infertility.

DESCRIPTION Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of diseases caused by hantaviruses which are members of family Bunyaviridae. HFRS is characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock and is caused by the serotypes Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava-Belgrade viruses. The serotype Puumala virus also causes nephropathia epidemica, a milder variant of HFRS.

NAME        Measles
DESCRIPTION Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by measles virus that belongs to genus Morbillivirus. Measles is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. An estimated 30-40 million people are affected, resulting in 777 000 deaths in 2002. Measles infection is characterized by immunosuppression and lymphopenia.

ENTRY       H00403                      Disease
NAME        Disorders of nucleotide excision repair, including:
            Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP);
            Cockayne syndrome (CS);
            UV-sensitive syndrome (UVS);
            Trichothiodystrophy (TTD);
            Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome (COFS);
            XFE progeroid syndrome
DESCRIPTION Mutations in genes on the nucleotide excision repair pathway are associated with diseases, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). XP is caused by mutations in XPA, ERCC3/XPB, XPC, ERCC2/XPD, DDB2/XPE, ERCC4/XPF, ERCC5/XPG and POLH. XP is classified into eight genetic complementation groups by the present. In this inside, 7groups from the XP-A group to the G group show the abnormality in NER. The symptoms of XP begin in early life. Severe sunburn and blistering occurs in a half of patients, and all show early extensive freckling. Cancer incidence for individuals with XP under 20 years of age is 2,000 times as high as incidence in the general population. Neurodegeneration can be correlated with mutations in specific XP genes (XPA, ERCC3, ERCC2 and ERCC5). Some patients of XP- A develop neurologic symptoms or a more severe clinical phenotype known as de Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, associated with mutations in the ERCC6 gene. CS is caused by mutations in ERCC8/CSA, ERCC6/CSB. CS is predominantly a developmental and neurological disorder. It results in a severely reduced lifespan but is not linked to an increased incidence of cancer. The three of the XP genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and ERCC5) are also found to be mutated XP/CS patients (exhibiting both XP and Cockayne's symptoms). ERCC6 is a cause of UV-sensitive syndrome (UVS) which is characterized by photosensitivity and mild freckling but without neurological abnormalities or skin tumors. TTD is a premature aging syndrome, with the hallmark feature of brittle hair and nails, ichthyosis, and progressive mental and physical retardation. Within photo-sensitive TTD, three TFIIH coding genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and TTDA/GTF2H5) are implicated. Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is rare autosomal recessive disorder with microcephaly, severe mental retardation, and death in childhood. COFS can result from mutations in ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5 and ERCC6.

DESCRIPTION Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is a benign pediatric condition caused by B19 parvovirus. It is a mild, self-limiting 'slapped-cheek' facial rash with low-grade fever and malaise in immunocompetent children. However, B19 parvovirus is associated with a wide clinical spectrum ranging from thrombocytopenia and neurological manifestations in immunocompromised patients and intrauterine fetal death in primary infected pregnant women.

DESCRIPTION Since the discovery in 1980s, HIV/AIDS has become the most important infectious disease globally. Many of the clinical features of HIV/AIDS can be ascribed to the profound immune deficiency in patients. HIV infection also increases the risk of autoimmune diseases and malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma.

ENTRY       H00407                      Disease
NAME        Peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme deficiency, including:
            Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) deficiency;
            D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency;
            Perrault syndrome;
            Sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) deficiency;
            2-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMCR) deficiency;
            Hypercholanemia
DESCRIPTION Peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme deficiency is a group of inherited peroxisomal diseases caused by mutation of one of genes that encode peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system enzymes. The system includes straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1), 2-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR), D-bifunctional protein (DBP) and sterol carrier protein X (SCPx). It is known that some types of fatty acids including very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), branched-chain fatty acid, and the bile acid synthesis intermediates, rely fully on peroxisomes for beta-oxidation. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of these fatty acids in many organs. The clinical manifestations mimic those of the Zellweger syndrome spectrum. [DS:H00205]

ENTRY       H00408                      Disease
NAME        Type I diabetes mellitus
DESCRIPTION The majority of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cases are believed to arise from an inflammatory, autoimmune attack against the beta cells in the pancreas, which consequently leads to the failure of insulin-mediated blood glucose regulation in the body. T1DM signs and symptoms can come on quickly and may include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss and so on. It is recognized that both genetic and environmental determinants are important in defining disease risk. The HLA class II genes are most strongly associated with T1DM. Another plausible candidate genes are INS, CTLA4 and PTPN22. The disease may be a result of variations in several susceptibility genes, with the majority only contributing weak effects.

Both insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are thought to result from the complex interplay of many different pathways under the combined control of environmental and genetic factors. It is accepted that T2DM results from population aging and adverse environmental factors of the modern world which favor the development of obesity.

NAME        Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
DESCRIPTION Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of familial diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset before 25 years of age and primary insulin secretion defects. Mutations in six genes, encoding the glucose sensor enzyme glucokinase and five transcription factors that participate in a regulatory network essential for adult beta cell function, cause most of the MODY cases.

NAME        Hepatitis A;
            Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection
DESCRIPTION Hepatitis A accounts for 20 to 25% of clinically apparent hepatitis cases worldwide. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and in countries with poor sanitary conditions, the population acquires infection in childhood. In these cases, infection causes only minimal illness. In developed countries with good sanitation, people sometimes acquire hepatitis A by travelling to endemic areas, and infection in adults causes severe icteric hepatitis.

DESCRIPTION Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral disease caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. HCV is a major cause of persistent liver disease, with approximately 170 million individuals infected worldwide. Up to 80% of patients will have chronic infection, causing degenerative liver disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis over 20 years after infection. Some of these patients will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HCV infection is the leading indication for liver transplantation.

DESCRIPTION Hepatitis E is an infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) that is transmitted through fecal-oral route. The disease is highly endemic in developing countries with poor sanitation and contamination of drinking water. Its case-fatality rates are in the range of 0.5% to 4%. Hepatitis E manifests as acute icteric hepatitis in high-endemicity areas. However, in recent years, cases of hepatitis E have been observed in low-endemicity areas as well, including chronic hepatitis E with higher mortality rate.

DESCRIPTION Alstrom syndrome (AS) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by multiorgan dysfunction. AS shares several features with the common metabolic syndrome, namely obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. A wide range of clinical variability is observed among individuals with AS, including among sibs. ALMS1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with AS. However, it is not yet known how this gene causes the disorder.

NAME        Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)
DESCRIPTION Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with genetic heterogeneity characterized by defects in multiple organ systems. The main features are retinal degeneration, obesity, hypogonadism, polydactyly, renal dysfunction, and mental retardation. BBS is typified by clinical variability observed both within and between families, which can be explained in part by the presence of second-site modifiers. Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that the BBS phenotype is largely associated with ciliary dysfunction.

NAME        Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL)
DESCRIPTION Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by near total absence of adipose tissue from birth. Several metabolic alterations in carbohydrate (diabetes mellitus) and lipid metabolism and involvement of heart, bone and ovaries are also observed in this disease. Patients typically have low serum levels of leptin and adiponectin. Several genes were studied to identify the molecular alteration responsible for CGL, which have been found to contribute to lipid droplet formation in adipocytes.

ENTRY       H00420                      Disease
NAME        Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL), including the following four diseases:
            Kobberling-type lipodystrophy (FPLD1);
            Dunnigan-type lipodystrophy (FPLD2);
            Dunnigan-like lipodystrophy (FPLD3);
            AKT2 associated lipodystrophy
DESCRIPTION Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable loss of body fat from the extremities as well as from the truncal region. LMNA, PPARG and AKT2 have been identified in association with FPL. However, it is not yet known how these genes cause the disorder. Besides them, additional loci are likely as many FPL patients do not reveal any mutations in these genes. LMNA mutations may affect nuclear function, and may be involved in apoptosis and premature cell death of adipocytes, thus causing lipodystrophy. PPARG and AKT2 are regulators of adipocyte differentiation. AKT2 is also involved in postreceptor insulin signaling. Thus, mutations in these two genes could result in lipodystrophy. The reason why loss of fat is restricted to partial areas remains unknown.

            Hurler-Scheie syndrome (type1) [DS:H00128];
            Hunter syndrome (type2) [DS:H00129];

            Hyaluronidase deficiency (type9) [DS:H00133]
DESCRIPTION Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activity of enzymes that play important roles in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. MPS2/ Hunter syndrome is an X-linked disease and the others are autosomal recessive diseases. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate in many organs, as well as elevated metabolite levels in urine. The MPS diseases share many clinical features that include organomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, decreased growth, and recurrent infections. Most of MPS diseases do not affect the nervous system, and are considered as potentially amenable to enzyme replacement therapy.

            Schindler/ Kanzaki disease [DS:H00146]
DESCRIPTION Glycoproteinoses is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activty of enzymes that play important roles in the degradation of glycoproteins such as N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides. The lack of a single enzyme leads to the complete blockage of the catabolic chain and results in the accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharides in lysosomes. Glycoproteinoses share many clinical features such as mental retardation, coarse facies, and dysostosis multiplex. Cathepsin A-deficiency causes combined sialidase and beta-galactosidase deficiency (Sialidosis and Galactosialidosis) due to its function in stabilising these two hydrolases.

ENTRY       H00423                      Disease
NAME        Defects in the degradation of sulfatide, including:
            Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) [DS:H00127];
            Krabbe disease/ Globoid cell leukodystrophy [DS:H00135]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of sulfatide is a group of autosomal recessive demyelinating lysosomal storage diseases including Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe disease. MLD caused by deficiency of lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and Krabbe disease caused by deficiency of galactosylceramidase. The enzyme defects result in the accumulation of sulfatide and galactocerebroside in the central and peripheral nervous systems and extensive white matter damage and loss of both cognitive and motor functions. Mutated PSAP gene resulting in sphingolipid activator proteins (saposin) Saposin B deficiency is known to cause MLD variant in which ARSA is normal. It is also known that saposin A and saposin C are able to stimulate the step of galactocerebroside degradation.

NAME        Defects in the degradation of sphingomyelin, including:
            Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), type A/ B [DS:H00137];
            Farber lipogranulomatosis [DS:H00138]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of sphingomyelin is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases including Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), type A/B and Farber lipogranulomatosis. NPD caused by deficient acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity, and Farber lipogranulomatosis is caused by acid ceramidase deficiency, resulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin, ceramide and cholesterol in many organs. ASM and acid ceramidase are key enzymes of the two steps degradation of sphingomyelin and play important roles in normal membrane turnover.

COMMENT     NPD typeA is the infantile form characterized by a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to early death. NPD typeB is the later-onset form in which patients exhibit little or no neurological symptoms, but may have severe and progressive visceral organ abnormalities, including hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular disease. The different clinical presentations of Types A and B NPD are likely due to small differences in the amount of residual, functional ASM activity.

NAME        Lysosomal cysteine protease deficiencies, including:
            Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) [DS:H00274];
            Pycnodysostosis [DS:H00273]
DESCRIPTION Defects in lysosomal cysteine proteases (Cathepsins) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases. To date only following two human diseases cathepsin deficiencies have been described, though there are eleven lysosomal cystein proteases. Deficiency of cathepsin C leads to Papillon-Lefevre syndrome characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis. Deficiency of cathepsin K leads to pycnodysostosis characterized by osteosclerosis and short stature. Recent findings suggest a more expanded role for cathepsins in human biology.

COMMENT     In mice, other Cathepsin deficiencies have also been generated. Deficiency of cathepsin F causes lysosomal storage defects and late-onset neurological disease. Lacking cathepsin L develop periodic hair loss. Recent findings suggest a more expanded role for cathepsins in human biology. These roles include apoptosis, MHC class II immune responses, prohormone processing, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling important to cardiovascular or bone development. Cathepsins may also lead to accelerated collagen and elastin degradation and cause the diseases such as atherosclerosis.

            Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidoses type 1) [DS:H00124];
            Sandhoff disease (GM2 gangliosidoses type 2) [DS:H00124];
            Gaucher disease [DS:H00126]
DESCRIPTION Defects in the degradation of ganglioside is a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by deficient activty of enzymes or their activators that play important roles in the degradation of ganglioside. The lack of a single enzyme leads to the complete blockage of the catabolic chain and results in the accumulation of undegraded substrates such as keratan sulfate, gangliosides, glucosylceramide and glycopeptides in neurons and skeletal tissues. Deficiency of the GM2 activator protein causes the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis. And saposin C is an activator of beta-glucocerebrosidase.

ENTRY       H00427                      Disease
NAME        Relapsing fever
DESCRIPTION Relapsing fever was once a major global epidemic disease. Louseborne relapsing fever is now geographically limited, but tickborne relapsing fever still causes major health problems in Africa. The symptoms are variable. Relapsing fever spirochaetes persist in the brain, which can be reactivated on immunosuppression.

ENTRY       H00428                      Disease
NAME        Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 1)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. The distal type of RTA (dRTA) arises when the collecting duct fails to remove excess acid into the urine and is characterized by the inability to lower urine pH maximally (below 5.5) in the face of spontaneous acidemia or after acid loading. Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of dRTA are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl-/HCO3- exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H+-ATPase, the V1 subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V0 subunit a4.

NAME        Proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 2)
DESCRIPTION Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Proximal RTA (type 2) is caused by an impairment of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules, resulting in low renal bicarbonate threshold. Mutations in the gene SLC4A4, encoding Na+-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC-1), have been found in proximal RTA.

NAME        Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP)
DESCRIPTION Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare disorder that leads to progressive ossification of muscle tissue and connective tissue. This process becomes noticeable in early childhood. Affected individuals harbor missense mutations in the ACVR1A gene that brings about constitutive activation of BMP type I receptor. FOP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

ENTRY       H00435                      Disease
NAME        Toxoplasmosis
DESCRIPTION The intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is distributed worldwide among warm-blood animals. In humans, the infection rate is estimated at 10-30 %. Infection is acquired by ingestion of the parasite released by parasitized cats or contained in undercooked meat. The parasite usually causes asymptomatic infection but in immunocompromised indivisuals, it can result in fatal disease with encephalitis. Transmission can also occur vertically. Congenital infection causes spontaneous abortion or serious defects such as hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and intracranial calcification in infants.

NAME        Osteopetrosis, including:
            Osteopetrosis, severe neonatal or infantile forms;
            Osteopetrosis, intermediate forms;
            Osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis;
            Osteopetrosis, late-onset form type 1;
            Osteopetrosis, late-onset form type 2;
            Osteopetrosis, osteoclast poor
DESCRIPTION The osteopetroses are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by increased bone density and the replacement of trabecular bone with compact bone due to reduced osteoclastic bone resorption. Some osteopetrotic conditions exhibit additional clinical features including renal tubular acidosis and secondary neurological impairment. In forms of osteopetrosis with normal osteoclast counts, most of the mutated genes encode proteins that regulate the intra- and extracellular pH of osteoclasts, such as TCIRG1 gene encoding for the a3 subunit of the V-ATPase and ClCN7 gene. In cases with decreased osteoclast counts, osteoclast differentiation is impaired by mutations in RANKL or RANK. These RANK-deficient patients could be rescued by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

NAME        Paget's disease of bone and related disorders, including: ;
            Paget's disease of bone (PDB);
            Familial expansile osteolysis (FEO);
            Early-onset Paget's disease of bone (PDB2);
            Expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia (ESH);
            Juvenile Paget's disease (JPD)
DESCRIPTION Paget's disease of bone and related disorders are rare inherited osteolytic disorders that show phenotypic overlap. Patients with these diseases carry mutations in RANK, OPG or SQSTM1, resulting in activation of RANKL-RANK signaling axis with increases in bone resorption. Hearing impairment and tooth loss is common. Apart from JPD, the condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

NAME        Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL);
            Nasu-Hakola disease
DESCRIPTION Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL), or Nasu-hakola disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. It is characterized by repeated fractures occurring during adolescence and progressive presenile dementia in the fourth decade. The disease is caused by a mutation in the TREM2 or DAP12 gene that regulates osteoclast differentiation. TREM2-DAP12 is also expressed by microglia, thus neurological impairments seen in this disease are considered to be directly caused by microglial dysfunstion.

NAME        Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis
DESCRIPTION Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OSCS) is a bone dysplasia characterized by longitudinal striations in the metaphyseal region of the long bones and sclerosis of the craniofacial bones. The condition is X-linked dominant. Germline mutations in WTX gene cause OSCS through increased osteoblast activity.

NAME        Oral-facial-digital syndrome
DESCRIPTION Oral-facial-digital syndrome is a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity and digits. OFD type I is a male lethal disorder and due to mutations in the OFD1 gene on the X chromosome. OFD type IV is due to mutations in the TCTN3 gene and patients have tibial dysplasia. OFD type V is due to mutations in the DDX59 gene and patients show the core features of cleft palate, lobulated tongue, and polydactyly.

NAME        Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including:
            SMA type I (SMA1) / Werdning-Hoffman disease;
            SMA type II (SMA2);
            SMA type III (SMA3) / Kugeleberg-Welander disease;
            SMA type IV (SMA4);
            X-linked SMA (SMAX);

            Congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy (SMAL);
            SMA proximal adult autosomal dominant (SMAPAD)
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and paralysis. The most common form of SMA is caused by mutations of the SMN gene, that encodes the SMN protein, which regulates snRNP assembly. Four types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease: type I (Werdning-Hoffman), type II (intermediate), type III (Kugeleberg-Welander) and type IV (adult form). Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy are caused by mutation of other genes, some known and others not yet defined.

NAME        Patella dysplasias, including:
            Small patella syndrome (SPS);
            Nail-patella syndrome;
            Ear-patella-short statute syndrome
DESCRIPTION Patella dysplasias are a group of disorders that include aplasia/hypoplasia of patellar. Small patella syndrome is a skeletal dysplasia with anomalies of the pelvis. Ossification of the ischia and inferior pubic rami is also disrupted in patients with small patella syndrome. Nail-patella syndrome is a condition caused by mutation in LMX1B that regulates COL4A4 and COL4A3 expression. The most common associated abnormality is nail dysplasia. Ear-patella-short statute syndrome is characterized by microtia and growth retardation due to delayed skeletal development.

NAME        Fragile X Syndrome, including:
            Fragile X Syndrome (FXS);
            Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)
DESCRIPTION Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a cognitive disorder caused by silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Absence of the associated protein FMRP leads to the dysregulation of many genes creating a phenotype of ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy and autism.There are also several physical features commonly associated with FXS, including elongated faces, prominent ears, and macroorchidism. The most prevalent genetic aberration at the FMR1 locus arises from a noncoding CGG repeat in the 5'untranslated region. Expansion of this region can give rise to FXS or fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).

NAME        Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS)
DESCRIPTION Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDSs) are a group of heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders associated with a severe reduction in mitochondrial DNA in the affected tissues. The manifestations vary from tissue-specific mtDNA depletion to wide-spread multisystemic disorders. Some genes are known to underlie this group of disorders, and many disease genes are still unidentified. However, the disease mechanisms seem to be intimately associated with mtDNA replication and nucleotide pool regulation.

ENTRY       H00474                      Disease
NAME        Schneckenbecken dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Schneckenbecken dysplasia is a severe skeletal dysplasia that leads to perinatal death. The characteristic is the snail-like configuration of the hypoplastic iliac bones. Patients also have limbs with extremely short long bones and flat vertebratal bodies. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC35D1 gene impair the transporter activity of nucleotide sugars in Schneckenbecken dysplasia. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

NAME        Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, including:
            Angelman syndrome (AS);
            Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
DESCRIPTION Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are the most studied genomic-imprinting disorders mapped to chromosome 15q11-q13. Lack of a functional paternal copy of 15q11-q13 causes PWS. On the other hand, lack of a functional maternal copy of UBE3A, a gene within 15q11-q13, causes AS. Additionally, it has been reported that MECP2 deficiency leads to decreased expression of UBE3A. They both have characteristic neurologic, developmental, and behavioral phenotypes plus other structural and functional abnormalities. However, the cognitive and neurologic impairment is more severe in AS, including seizures and ataxia. The behavioral and endocrine disorders are more severe in PWS, including obsessive-compulsive symptoms and hypothalamic insufficiency.

ENTRY       H00480                      Disease
NAME        Non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation
DESCRIPTION X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), depending on whether further abnormalities are found on physical examination, laboratory investigation and brain imaging. The majority of genes that are mutated in NS-XLMR encode proteins are involved in three distinct pathways: Rho GTPases pathway modulating neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity; Rab GTPases pathway regulating synaptic vesicle cycling; gene expression regulation.

NAME        Cone-rod dystrophy and cone dystrophy, including:
            Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD);
            Cone dystrophy (COD);
            Retinal cone dystrophy (RCD)
DESCRIPTION Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) and cone dystrophy (COD) are a subgroup of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptor function. In contrast to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), deterioration of the cone cells is more severe than the rod cells. In CORD, there is a progressive loss of cone photoreceptor function followed by gradual loss of rod photoreceptor function and retinal degeneration. In COD, cone function decreases progressively from its onset, though rod function is well preserved until the late stages of the disease.

Congenital cardiovascular malformations are seen in 60% of the cases. Loss-of-function mutations in EVC or EVC2 genes and resulting hedgehog signaling defects are causative of this disease. Weyers acrodental dysostosis is an allelic dominant disorder with milder phenotype.

NAME        Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), including:
            X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DKCX);
            Autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita (DKCA1);
            Autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita (DKCB1)
DESCRIPTION Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a severe inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with associated cutaneous and noncutaneous abnormalities. In most cases, the inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive, while autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms have been reported. Remarkably, all causative gene mutations identified to date share a link to telomere/telomerase biology. Moreover, dyskeratosis congenita is linked to defective ribosome biogenesis.

NAME        Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM)
DESCRIPTION Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), which is a monogenic form of diabetes, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia in the first 6 months of life. NDM is categorized into transient (TNDM) and permanent (PNDM). In the case of PNDM, the condition does not resolve over time. The most frequent causes of PNDM are heterozygous mutations in the KCNJ11, INS and ABCC8 genes that play a critical role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. The responsible genes remain unknown in up to 40% of patients.

NAME        Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM)
DESCRIPTION Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), which is a monogenic form of diabetes, is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia in the first 6 months of life. NDM is categorized into transient (TNDM) and permanent (PNDM). TNDM is a developmental disorder of insulin production that resolves by age 18 months but can reappear later in life. TNDM is different from type 1 diabetes since no islet cell antibodies or autoimmune phenomenon were found in these patients. 6q24-related TNDM is an imprinting disorder resulting from overexpression of at least two imprinted genes, PLAGL1 and HYMAI, on chromosome 6q24. Hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci is associated with mutations in ZFP57. Mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1 are other genetic causes of TNDM.

DESCRIPTION RNase MRP RNA is the RNA subunit of the RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) enzyme complex. In addition to its mitochondrial function, mutations on RNase MRP RNA gene (RMRP) cause a recessively inherited developmental disorder, cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH). CHH is a skeletal dysplasia inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Beyond CHH, RNase MRP RNA mutations have been implicated in a variety of other inherited skeletal dysplasias, including anauxetic dysplasia (AD) and metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis (MDWH).

NAME        Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome;
            Jacobs syndrome
DESCRIPTION The camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a lubricant for the cartilage surface. Affected individuals present with arthropathy associated with camptodactyly. Some patients have pericarditis with effusions.

NAME        Retinitis pigmentosa (RP)
DESCRIPTION Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited progressive retinal diseases characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss and night vision difficulties. RP can be divided into syndromic (40 %) and non-syndromic (60 %) forms. The most frequent forms of syndromic RP are Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in more than 50 genes are known to cause non-syndromic RP. Non-syndromic RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner.

NAME        Venous malformations, including:
            Sporadic venous malformation;
            Cutaneomucosal venous malformation;
            Glomuvenous malformation
DESCRIPTION Venous malformations are vascular anomalies that present with congenital blue-colored birthmarks resulted from dilated veins. Birthmarks in cutaneomucosal venous malformation appear mainly on skin and mucosa, whereas plaques in glomuvenous malformation are located on the extremities, usually nodular and associated with abnormal smooth muscle-like 'glomus cells'. The disease-causing genes are glomulin and TIE2, a receptor for angiogenic factors.

NAME        Cerebral cavernous malformation
DESCRIPTION Cerebral cavernous malformations are vascular malformations of the central nervous system comprising enlarged caverns with a single layer of endothelium, which easily lead to cerebral hemorrhages. The disease present as either sporadic or autosomal dominant conditions and is linked to three genes KRIT1, MGC4607, and PDCD10. Mutations in KRIT1 impair its interaction with ICAP-1 alpha, a beta 1 integrin binding protein, and influence beta 1 integrin-dependent angiogenesis.

NAME        Atrial septal defect
DESCRIPTION Atrial septal defect is an abnormal hole in the interatrial septum between right and left atria. Atrial septal defect is one of the most frequent types of malformations in congenital heart defect that arise from perturbations of cardiac development during embryogenesis. Multiple transcriptions factors that regulate cardiac development as well as various chemicals and maternal diseases have been implicated in the disease.

NAME        Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD), including:
            Hyperglycerolemia;
            Chromosome Xp21 deletion syndrome;
            X-linked Addison disease (AHX);
            Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
DESCRIPTION Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is an X-linked recessive enzyme defect characterized biochemically by hyperglycerolemia and glyceroluria. There are two types, an isolated form and a complex form. The complex GKD is an Xp21 contiguous gene syndrome involving the glycerol kinase locus together with X-linked Addison disease (AHX) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) loci or both.

DESCRIPTION CHARGE syndrome is a rare, usually sporadic disorder with multiple congenital anomalies. CHARGE is an acronym for the six prevalent clinical features of the disease, namely, coloboma, heart defect, atresia of choanae, retardation of growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies/deafness. Abnormal semicircular canals, arhinencephaly, and rhombencephalic dysfunctions are also considered as important features. Nearly 2/3 of cases harbor mutations within the CHD7 gene.

            Wrinkly skin syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cutis laxa is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders with variable organ involvement. The most obvious symptom of cutis laxa is loose and sagging skin due to reduced elastic fibers in the dermis. The phenotype of autosomal recessive cutis laxa II includes abnormal growth, developmental delay, and associated skeletal abnormalities. Autosomal recessive cutis laxa III, also known as De Barsy syndrome, is characterized by an aged appearance with distinctive facial features, sparse hair, ophthalmologic abnormalities, and intrauterine growth retardation.

NAME        von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
DESCRIPTION von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with tumors in the central nervous system and other organs. The most frequent tumors are cerebellar and retinal haemangioblastomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma in the adrenal gland, epididymal cystadenoma, and endolymphatic sac tumours. Germline inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor protein leads to the upregulation of HIF and promotes to carcinogenesis.

NAME        Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, including:
            Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE);
            Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder with multiple coagulation factor deficiency
DESCRIPTION Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a multisystem genetic disorder characterized by aberrant mineralization of elastic fibers in connective tissue affecting the skin, eyes and the arterial blood vessels. The mutated gene is identified as ABCC6, an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Recently, PXE with coagulation factor deficiency is shown to be associated with GGCX, which encodes an enzyme required for gamma-glutamyl carboxylation of proteins.

NAME        Brachydacytly-mental retardation syndrome and Smith-Magenis syndrome
DESCRIPTION Brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), also known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome, is a complex disorder characterized by brachymetaphalangia and mental retardation including autism spectrum disorder. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is associated with skeletal anomalies and variable mental retardation. Individuals with these two disorders have very similar features. Mutation of the BDMR-causative gene HDAC4 results in reduced expression of RAI1, whose haploinsufficiency leads to SMS.

NAME        Dystrophinopathies, including:
            Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD);
            Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD);
            X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM)
DESCRIPTION Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by weakness of leg, pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles starting in early childhood. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a milder variant of DMD with a better prognosis, with a mean age of onset at 11 years. X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM) is a rare disorder with rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy but almost no skeletal muscle impairment. Absence of the dystrophin protein (DMD) and reduced levels or abnormal configuration of dystrophin (BMD) leads to membrane fragility making muscle cells susceptible to damage from contraction. Secondary increase in free radicals and activation of calcium-dependent proteases are thought to further contribute to muscle degeneration. Recently, heterozygous MYF6 mutation is reported to be associated with BMD.

NAME        Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by the clinical triad of joint contractures that begin in early childhood, slowly progressive muscle weakness and wasting initially in a humeroperoneal distribution that later extends to the scapular and pelvic girdle muscles, and cardiac involvement that usually occurs after the second decade of life. So far, five genes, EMD (emerin), LMNA, SYNE (nesprin)1, SYNE2 and FHL1, have been associated to EDMD phenotypes, that can be inherited following an X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Most of genes known to be associated with EDMD are critical for nuclear envelope integrity.

DESCRIPTION Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with recurrent oto-sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, and infertility owing to impaired motile ciliary function. Alterations in the left-right organization of the internal organ positioning, which is caused by dysfunctional nodal cilia in early developmental stage, occur in approximately 50% of PCD patients and this combination is referred as Kartagener syndrome.

NAME        Sarcoglycanopathies, including:
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2C;
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2D;
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2E;
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2F
DESCRIPTION Sarcoglycanopathies are a group of a four genetically closely related muscular dystrophies with a phenotype often similar to the X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DS:H00562]. It has been demonstrated that pathological mutations of the alpha-sarcoglycan (SG), beta-SG, gamma-SG, and delta-SG genes cause autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies. Clinical presentation of sarcoglycanopathies is characterized by a slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, leading to loss of ambulation during adolescence in most patients.

            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B;
            Distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT)
DESCRIPTION Dysferlinopathies encompass a large variety of neuromuscular diseases characterized by the absence of dysferlin in skeletal muscle and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Dysferlin is a sarcolemmal protein involved in an important role in repairing defects in skeletal membrane. The clinical phenotype is quite variable. Affected individuals usually present with early involvement of the posterior calf muscles, but can present with proximal greater than distal weakness, and less commonly with anterior tibial weakness.

NAME        Caveolinopathies, including:
            Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 1C;
            Rippling muscle disease (RMD);

            Distal myopathy with decreased caveolin 3;
            Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
DESCRIPTION Caveolinopathies are a group of muscle diseases and can lead to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The same mutation could lead to heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and muscle histopathological changes. They are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Recently, an autosomal recessive inheritance was considered. The clinical findings that may suggest the diagnosis of a caveolinopathy are: onset usually in the first two decades, progressive, proximal, symmetrical muscle weakness, positive Gowers sign, calf hypertrophy, myalgia, cramps, and/or stiffness after exercise, muscle hyperirritability, etc.

ENTRY       H00568                      Disease
NAME        Myotonic dystrophy (DM)
DESCRIPTION Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a complex multisystemic disorder linked to two different genetic loci. DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. DM2 is caused by an unstable CCTG repeat in intron 1 of ZNF9. Therefore, both DMs are caused by a repeat expansion in a region transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein. The mutant RNA transcripts aberrantly affect the splicing of the same target RNAs, such as chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) and insulin receptor (INSR), resulting in their shared myotonia and insulin resistance. Affected individuals express highly heterogeneous, multisystemic symptoms including myotonia (muscle hyperexcitability), progressive muscle weakness and wasting, cataract development, testicular atrophy, and cardiac conduction defects. It has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and disease severity generally correlates with repeat length.

NAME        Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS)
DESCRIPTION Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation, which is characterized in male patients by psychomotor and growth retardation and various skeletal anomalies. Typical facial changes and specific clinical and radiological signs in the hand are useful aids in the diagnosis. Mutations in the RSK2 (RPS6KA3) gene cause CLS. The RPS6KA3 gene encodes RSK2 that is involved with signaling within cells.

NAME        Renal tubular dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION Autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD) is a rare lethal disorder characterized by the absence or incomplete differentiation of proximal tubules. Patients present persistent fetal anuria leading to oligohydramnios sequence. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensin II receptor type 1 may cause RTD. These genes are renin-angiotensin system components which regulate renal growth during embryogenesis.

DESCRIPTION X-linked mental retardation (XMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), depending on whether further abnormalities are found on physical examination, laboratory investigation and brain imaging. Epilepsy is often associated with MR. Although this does not always indicate that the two conditions share the same genetic defects, a genetic correlation between MR and epilepsy has been suggested in some diseases.

NAME        MYH9-related kidney diseases, including:
            Epstein syndrome;
            Fechtner syndrome
DESCRIPTION Epstein and Fechtner syndromes are rare autosomal dominant progressive nephropathies associated with macrothrombocytopenia. Sensorineural hearing loss can also occur. Fechtner syndrome shows the additional features of cataracts and blue leukocyte inclusion bodies (Doehle-like bodies). Both disorders are linked to mutations in MYH9, the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain.

NAME        Alport syndrome
DESCRIPTION Alport syndrome is a hereditary hematuric nephropathy with frequent hearing loss and ocular anomalies. Defects of basement membranes arise from mutations in alpha 3, alpha 4, and alpha 5 type IV collagen chains. The mode of inheritance is either X-linked or autosomal recessive, although autosomal dominant form has been observed in a few families. Male patients with X-linked Alport syndrome suffer from severe renal symptoms that progress to end-stage renal disease associated with deafness which starts during the first decade of life, and ocular lesions including anterior lenticonus. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is usually severe, showing progressive nephritis and hearing impairment.

DESCRIPTION Benign familial hematuria is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent dysmorphic hematuria detected in childhood. The glomerular basement membrane is uniformly thin, but renal function is normal. Heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 lead to reduced collagen network levels in the basement membrane.

NAME        Opitz-GBBB syndrome
DESCRIPTION Opitz GBBB syndrome is a pleiotropic genetic disorder characterized by hypertelorism, hypospadias, and additional midline defects. This syndrome was originally described as two distinct entities, the BBB syndrome with cleft lip, palate and mental retardation, and the G-syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal anomalies. Subsequently, both syndromes were merged and reclassified as Opitz GBBB syndrome. There are two forms of Opitz GBBB syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and patterns of inheritance. The X-linked form is caused by a mutation in the gene MID1 that encodes an ubiquitin ligase that targets phosphatase 2A for degradation. Autosomal dominant form results from a deletion at chromosome 22q11.2.

DESCRIPTION Inherited epidermolysis bullosa is a diverse group of disorders characterized by mechanically fragile skin that readily blister. The dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, in which tissue separation occurs in the dermis, are inherited in either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. In the most severe subtype of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa,  there is esophageal stenosis and pseudosyndactyly.

NAME        Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), including:
            Exudative vitreoretinopathy 1 (EVR1);
            Exudative vitreoretinopathy2, X-linked  (EVR2);
            Exudative vitreoretinopathy 4 (EVR4);
            Exudative vitreoretinopathy 5 (EVR5);
            Norrie disease (ND)
DESCRIPTION Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and Norrie disease (ND) are two inherited retinal disorders with highly overlapping ocular manifestations that are caused by alterations in the Wnt signaling network. FEVR and ND share an abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina with the formation of retinal folds, retinal detachment, and in many cases the creation of a fibrovascular membrane located behind the lens. ND is a severe X-linked recessive form of congenital blindness, which in about one-third of the cases is accompanied by mental retardation and deafness. Mutations in NDP, FZD4, and LRP5 have been reported to be responsible for ophthalmic diseases including ND, FEVR, and osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome. The proteins encoded by these genes have all been shown to participate in the Wnt/Norrin signaling pathway. Recently, heterozygous mutations in TSPAN12, which is a component of the Norrin-FZD4-LRP5 signaling complex, have been found to be responsible for autosomal dominant FEVR.

NAME        Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)
DESCRIPTION Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a usually autosomal dominant inherited form of muscular dystrophy. At disease onset, typically in the second decade of life, FSHD is characterized by initially restricted weakness of shoulder and facial muscles. With progression, the lower extremities, both distal and proximal, become involved. FSHD is caused by a reduction in the copy number of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. However, the reduction of D4Z4 copy number is not sufficient by itself to cause FSHD. A number of epigenetic events appear to affect the severity of the disease, its rate of progression, and the distribution of muscle weakness.

DESCRIPTION Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness that begins from the proximal limb muscles. The disease is not congenital, with the age at onset of symptoms varying from early childhood to late adulthood. The primary distinction is between the autosomal dominant (LGMD1) and the autosomal recessive forms (LGMD2). According to the disease mechanisms, the LGMDs may be grouped as follows: dystrophin-dystroglycan complex defects LGMD2C, D, E, F, I, K, M, N, O, P; membrane defects LGMD1C, LGMD2B, L; enzymatic LGMD2A, H; sarcomeric LGMD1A, LGMD2G, J; and nuclear lamina LGMD1B.

DESCRIPTION Distal dystrophies-distal myopathies are a group of heterogeneous inherited primary muscle disorders classified into one broad category due to the presentation of weakness involving the distal skeletal muscles. Clinical presentation is characterized by progressive muscular weakness and atrophy beginning in the hands, forearm, lower legs or feet. Currently almost 20 different entities of distal muscular dystrophies have been genetically determined. Half of the genes have been associated with distal phenotypes only, whereas the other genes can manifest also with other than distal phenotypes. Most of the genes code for structural and functional components of the sarcomere. The genes responsible for the pathologically defined category of myofibrillar myopathy are frequently display a distal phenotype.

NAME        Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM), including:
            Desminopathy (MFM1);
            alpha-B Crystallinopathy (MFM2);

            Bag3opathy
DESCRIPTION Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a group of genetically distinct disorders linked by common morphologic features observed on muscle histology. MFM is characterized by slowly progressive weakness that can involve both proximal and distal muscles. Distal muscle weakness is more pronounced than proximal weakness. All disease proteins identified to date are involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Z-disk. The pathology includes accumulations of these proteins irrespective of primary gene defect, suggesting that these share molecular pathways involved in actin dynamics organized by the Z-disk. Besides accumulations of these proteins, congophilic amyloid products of myofibrillar degradation and ectopic aggregation of dystrophin and gelsolin appear in abnormal myofibers.

            Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV);
            Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM)
DESCRIPTION Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) is an adult onset slowly progressive myopathy secondary to mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene that encodes a bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in sialic acid biosynthesis. DMRV is a myopathy involving distal muscles, although other muscles are likewise involved. The pathological characteristics are the presence of rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers, but are not specific to this myopathy, and the presence of scattered small angular and atrophic fibers.

DESCRIPTION 46,XX disorder of sex development (46,XX DSD) is a condition in which the individual shows ambiguous genitalia with a 46,XX karyotype. One of the categories of 46,XX DSD is disorders of gonadal development, which includes ovotesticular DSD, testicular DSD, and ovarian dysgenesis. Ovotesticular DSD is defined as the simultaneous presence of both testicular and ovarian tissue in the same individual. Approximately 1/3 of the ovotesticular DSD cases have SRY gene, the male-determining factor that is usually located at the Y chromosome. Testicular DSD patients, who have testicular tissue in the absence of an ovarian tissue, are phenotypically normal males. Ovarian dysgenesis is a disorder in which subjects with female phenotype fail to proceed to puberty.

NAME        46,XX disorders of sex development (Disorders related to androgen excess), including:
            Congenital adrenal hyperplasias;
            Glucocorticoid resistance;
            Aromatase deficiency
DESCRIPTION 46,XX disorder of sex development (46,XX DSD) is a condition in which the individual shows ambiguous genitalia with a 46,XX karyotype. Excess androgen during the critical period of sexual differentiation can lead to 46,XX fetus virilization. Congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH) and other genetic disorders in fetuses impair steroidogenesis, resulting in shunting of cortisol precursors to androgen synthesis and accumulation of the product. Masculinization of female fetuses is described in mothers harboring androgen-producing tumors. Luteoma of pregnancy is the most common source of these maternal-derived androgens.

NAME        46,XX disorders of sex development (Other), including:
            Mullerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism;
            McKusick-Kaufman syndrome
DESCRIPTION 46,XX disorder of sex development (46,XX DSD) is a condition in which the individual shows ambiguous genitalia with a 46,XX karyotype. Mullerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism is a phenotype characterized by the absence of Mullerian-derived structures and androgen excess. The causative gene is WNT4, whose overexpression leads to testicular DSD. McKusick-Kaufman syndrome is a rare developmental disorder with vaginal atresia.

NAME        Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome
DESCRIPTION Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by premature aging. Children born with HGPS begin to develop micrognathia, alopecia, prominent scalp vein, and wrinkled, aged-looking skin within the first year of life. Severe premature atherosclerosis can cause the death at an average age of 13.5 years. Mutations in lamin A/C, an important structural component of the nuclear envelope, have been reported.

NAME        Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)
DESCRIPTION Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), also known as familial hypoaldosteronism type I, is an autosomal dominant disease that causes hypertension, hypokalemia, decreased plasma renin activity and increased aldosterone levels. GRA is caused by a chimeric gene that links the 11 [beta]-hydroxylase promoter sequence to the aldosterone synthase gene's coding region. As a result, aldosterone is ectopically synthesized in the cortisol-secreting zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland under the control of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). The high levels of mineralocorticoids activate the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and upregulate Na reabsorption and K secretion. Most individuals have severe hypertension since infancy but milder phenotypes have been described.

NAME        Hypertension exacerbated in pregnancy
DESCRIPTION "Hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy" is a syndrome similar to Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) with autosomal dominant early-onset hypertension. The affected individuals have a gain of function mutation in the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), resulting in constitutively stimulated Na reabsorption. Hypertension is present in nonpregnant patients and may be severe, but the characteristic feature is marked worsening during pregnancy. The proposed explanation is that the mutation renders the receptor sensitive to nonmineralocorticoid steroids such as progesterone, the level of which rises 100-fold during pregnancy.

NAME        Deafness, autosomal dominant
DESCRIPTION Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal-dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. Autosomal-dominant forms of deafness are usually post-lingual and progressive. Dominant mutations may be consistent with initial function and subsequent hearing loss owing to accumulation of pathology.

NAME        Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy;
            Ohtahara syndrome
DESCRIPTION Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), also known as Ohtahara syndrome,is characterized by frequent tonic spasms of early onset within a few months of life, and a suppression-burst pattern in electroencephalography (EEG). Many causes have been considered for EIEE. It has been reported that 75% of the cases subsequently evolve to West syndrome, and later a much smaller number progress to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

ENTRY       H00607                      Disease
NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Disorders of gonadal development), including:
            Gonadal agenesis;
            Complete and partial gonadal dysgenesis;
            Testis regression;
            Ovotesticular DSD
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) caused by impaired gonadal development includes gonadal agenesis, gonadal dysgenesis, testicular regression, and ovotesticular DSD. Absence of testicular determination results in gonadal agenesis/complete dysgenesis characterized by female external and internal genitalia but fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics, whereas incomplete testicular determination cause partial dysgenesis which show ambiguous genitalia. Testicular regression is part of the clinical spectrum of partial 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. These forms of 46,XY DSD have been associated with mutations in several genes, and chromosome mosaicism is now recognized as one of the cause.

NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Disorders in androgen synthesis or action), including:
            Congenital adrenal hyperplasias;
            Leydig cell hypoplasia;
            Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) can be endocrine-related. Several enzymatic defects that result in insufficient production of testosterone have been reported. These androgen defects and impaired differentiation of Leydig cell, which secretes testosterone, can lead to ambiguous or completely feminized genitalia in 46,XY individuals. Furthermore, defective androgen action due to androgen receptor defects also cause feminization of 46,XY fetuses although they have normal levels of testosterone.

NAME        46,XY disorders of sex development (Other), including:
            Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome;
            Hypospadias;
            Cryptorchidism
DESCRIPTION 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) with other various causes includes persistent Mullerian duct syndrome, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. During embryogenesis, regression of the Mullerian duct is induced by anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in normal 46,XY individuals. In perisitent Mullerian duct syndrome, mutations of the AMH and AMH receptor produce persistence of the uterus and Fallopian tubes in males. Hypospadias is a congenital malformation with ectopic opening of the urethral meatus. Compromised androgen effects can cause this malformation. Cryptorchidism, or undescended testes, is a condition controlled by AMH and insulin-like hormone 3.

ENTRY       H00610                      Disease
NAME        Treacher Collins syndrome
DESCRIPTION Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare congenital birth disorder characterized by severe craniofacial defects. Autosomal dominant TCS1 and TCS2 are caused by mutations in the TCOF1 and POLR1D genes, respectively. Autosomal recessive TCS3 is caused by mutations in the POLR1C gene. The majority of TCS cases are caused by a mutation in TCOF1 gene which encodes a putative nucleolar phosphoprotein known as treacle. It has suggested that treacle is involved in the production of ribosomal RNA within cells. POLR1C and POLR1D encode subunits present in RNA polymerase I and III. Both of these polymerases are involved in ribosomal RNA transcription.

NAME        Primary open angle glaucoma
DESCRIPTION Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, and a major cause of irreversible blindness. POAG is often accompanied by ocular hypertension and characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, atrophy of the optic nerve, and visual field loss. To date, at least 20 genetic loci for POAG have been reported. And four causative genes (CYP1B1, MYOC, OPTN, and WDR36) are identified from these loci. In addition, recently, heterozygous NTF4 mutation was associated with the phenotype in a small percentage of patients.

NAME        Infantile cortical hyperostosis;
            Caffey disease
DESCRIPTION Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH) is a self-limiting inflammatory disease characterized by swelling of soft tissues and periosteal hyperostosis mainly affecting long bones, mandible, clavicles, and ribs. It usually affects infants less than 6 months of age and spontaneously heals in the first year of life. However severe prenatal form of ICH is lethal in which extensive hyperostosis affects nearly all long bones and the fetus presents with polyhydramnios.

DESCRIPTION Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) are autosomal recessive diseases with considerable overlapping. Abnormal accumulation of an unidentified hyaline material in body tissues can lead to joint contractures, osteopenia, thickened skin with hyperpigmentation, gingival hypertrophy, and diarrhea in ISH. JHF is a milder form with a later onset.

NAME        Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS)
DESCRIPTION Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severely impaired prenatal and postnatal growth, profound psychomotor retardation. Most patients do not survive beyond the first year of life, as a result of complications associated with reduced mobility and failure to thrive. Recently, a missense mutation in EMG1 was reported to be the cause of BCS. EMG1 is a putative methyltransferase that is required for biogenesis of the 40S subunit of the ribosome.

NAME        Alopecia neurologic defects and endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome)
DESCRIPTION Alopecia neurological defects and endocrinopathy syndrome (ANE syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disease that is clinically heterogeneous. ANE syndrome patients display multiple signs including a varied amount of hair loss, mental retardation, progressive loss of motor ability beginning in the second decade of life, hypogonadism, central adrenal insufficiency, short stature, microcephaly, and several other skeletal and skin abnormalities. The syndrome is caused by decreased expression of the nucleolar protein RBM28, known to be required for biogenesis of the 60S subunit of the ribosome.

ENTRY       H00624                      Disease
NAME        Familial cholestasis, including:
            Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC);
            Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC);
            Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP);
            North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC)
DESCRIPTION Familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive liver disorders characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis, which can be divided in three main groups based on phenotypical differences: progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). PFIC type 1, 2 and 3 are due to mutations in ATP8B1, ABCB11 and ABCB4, respectively. Each of these genes encodes a hepatocanalicular transporter, which is essential for the proper formation of bile. Mutations in ATP8B1 and ABCB11 can also result in the less severe phenotype of BRIC type 1 and 2, respectively, while heterozygous mutations in all three genes are associated with ICP. PFIC type 4 is caused by mutations in HSD3B7,and also known as congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1. North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) is a distinct, rapidly evolving form of familial cholestasis found in aboriginal children from northwestern Quebec. It has reported that a missense mutation in Cirhin causes NAIC. Cirhin/UTP4 is known to be required for ribosome biogenesis.

NAME        Tooth agenesis;
            Hypodontia
DESCRIPTION Tooth agenesis, or hypodontia/origodontia, refers to the congenital absence of a few teeth without any systemic disorders. Tooth development is a complex process that involves interactions between the oral epithelium and an underlying mesenchyme. Perturbation of this process results in tooth agenesis. This disease could be inherited as either an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked trait.

NAME        Nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
DESCRIPTION Congenital nephrotic syndrome (NS) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) form a spectrum of podocyte diseases. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 grams per day), hypoalbuminemia, and edema, and divided into steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant forms. Affected patients develop FSGS and progress to end-stage renal disease. FSGS is defined as a sclerosing lesion in glomerular capillaries.

ENTRY       H00627                      Disease
NAME        Premature ovarian failure
DESCRIPTION Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by amenorrhea before the age of 40 years with elevated levels of gonadotrophin (LH and FSH) and low levels of gonadal hormones (estrogens and inhibins). The causes of POF can be categorized into genetic and environmental mechanisms. X chromosome defects such as Turner syndrome or trisomy X as well as many genes including BMP15, FMR1, LHR, and FSHR are associated with POF development. For the environmental causes, medical intervention including surgeries and chemotherapies may lead to POF. Autoimmune ovarian failure consists another large category of POF.

NAME        Rheumatoid arthritis
DESCRIPTION Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune joint disease where persistent inflammation affects bone remodeling leading to progressive bone destruction. In RA, abnormal activation of the immune system elevates pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels, which can promote synovial angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration. The synovium forms a hyperplastic pannus with infiltrated macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes and invades joints by secreting proteinases and inducing osteoclast differentiation.

DESCRIPTION Heterotaxy, or situs ambiguus, is an abnormal arrangement of the thoracic and abdominal viscera. The phenotype with mirror-image reversed left-right axis is called situs inversus, while partial alterations in the left-right organization is referred to as heterotaxy. Heterotaxy is associated with perturbation of nodal signaling during embryogenesis.

NAME        Duane retraction syndrome
DESCRIPTION Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital disorder of eye movement that occurs in approximately 1 in 50 patients with strabismus. This condition prevents horizontal eye movement, with absence of outward movement and deficiency of inward movement. Normal ocular motility depends on precise relations between cranial motor neurons and their target, extraocular muscles. In DRS parients, absence of the abducens motor neurons and aberrant innervations of extraocular muscles by third cranial nerve have been reported.

NAME        ADULT syndrome
DESCRIPTION ADULT syndrome is an acronym for acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome. It is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ectrodactyly, excessive freckling, nail dysplasia, obstruction of lacrimal ducts, and hypodontia. ADULT syndrome differs from EEC syndrome, an allelic disorder, by the absence of facial clefting.

NAME        Incontinentia pigmenti
DESCRIPTION Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis mostly affecting females. Cutaneous manifestations are present along the lines of Blaschko and are subdivided into four stages: vesicular, verrucous, hyperpigmented, and atrophic. Other tissues of ectodermal origin are also affected, showing hair abnormalities, dental anomalies, and ophthalmologic and neurologic alterations. Familial incontinentia pigmenti is caused by mutations in the NEMO gene.

NAME        Ectodermal dysplasia, including:
            Ectodermal dysplasia, anhidrotic;
            Ectodermal dysplasia, hypohidrotic
DESCRIPTION These ectodermal dysplasias are caused by defective epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that involves the Ectodysplasin/Edar/Edaradd signaling pathway. Congenital anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a sex-linked disorder characterized by incomplete development of the dermis, resulting in the absence of hair follicles and sweat glands with anodontia in affected males. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is milder with sparse hair and sweat glands and oligodontia.

DESCRIPTION Barth syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of infancy characterized by myopathy, cardiomyopathy, cyclic neutropenia, short stature, low cholesterol, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Barth syndrome is due to mutations in the TAZ gene, the exact function of which is unknown but there are indications that it is directly involved in the metabolism of cardiolipin localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

NAME        McLeod syndrome
DESCRIPTION McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder including the CNS (chorea, epilepsy), the PNS (axonal polyneuropathy), and the blood cells (acanthocytosis of the erythrocytes) characterized by late onset abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. Mild myopathy is a common manifestation in most cases. Patients often present with mild, asymptomatic hyperCKemia. The absence of the XK membrane transport protein seems to be causative.

NAME        Scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM)
DESCRIPTION Scapuloperoneal syndrome encompasses a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders all characterized by slowly progressive weakness in the shoulder-girdle and peroneal muscles. Both neurogenic and myopathic scapuloperoneal syndromes exist, the latter being referred to as scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM). Distinct subtypes of SPM are caused by mutations in the sarcomeric muscle proteins desmin and myosin heavy chain 7. The X-linked dominant form of SPM (XSPM) is caused by mutations in the FHL1 gene.

NAME        Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA);
            Beals syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a Marfan-like appearance and arachnodactyly. Most affected individuals have 'crumpled' ears, contractures of major joints, and camptodactyly. Additional features include muscular hypoplasia and scoliosis. In contrast to Marfan syndrome, CCA does not affect the aorta or the eyes.

NAME        Ectopia lentis
DESCRIPTION Ectopia lentis (EL) is defined as displacement or malposition of the crystalline lens of the eye and is inherited in either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner. Subluxation of the lens is slowly progressive in the first two decades of life. EL may occur as an isolated form or as a part of disorders. Up to about 80% of Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients have bilateral EL.

NAME        Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes, including:
            Hexokinase (HK) deficiency;
            Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) deficiency;
            Triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency;
            Glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency;
            Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes is a group of red cell disorders caused by inherited abnormality of glycolytic enzymes. Neurological phenotypes have been found to be associated only with specific mutations affecting TPI, PGK and, in rare cases, GPI. The symptoms of TPI deficiency are generally much more severe than those of any other glycolytic enzyme deficiency.

ENTRY       H00668                      Disease
NAME        Anemia due to disorders of glutathione metabolism, including:
            Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [DS:H01375];
            Glutathione peroxidase deficiency;
            Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency;
            Glutathione synthetase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Anemia due to disorders of glutathione metabolism is a group of red cell disorders caused by inherited abnormality of enzymes of glutathione metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. A G6PD-deficient patient lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans. GCLC catalyzes the initial and the rate-limiting step of glutathione synthesis. Deficiency of GCLC is extremely rare. GSS deficiency is a more frequent cause of glutathione deficiency.

NAME        Pseudofolliculitis barbae
DESCRIPTION Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a common skin disorder occurring predominantly in males of African origin, characterized by acneiform papules and pustules that result in keloidal scarring localized to the facial and submental regions. It is caused when highly curved hair shafts repenetrate the skin. A single nucleotide polymorphism in KRT75, which leads to a disruptive Ala12Thr substitution, has been demonstrated in the disease.

NAME        Achondrogenesis type IA
DESCRIPTION Achondrogenesis type IA is an extremely rare neonatal lethal chondrodysplasia. The disorder shows poorly ossified vertebral bodies/skull and completely lacked columnar-zone of the growth plate cartilage. Retention of fibrillar material within the rough endoplasmic reticulum is caused by mutated TRIP11 encoding Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein 210 in the Golgi apparatus.

NAME        Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD);
            Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD)
DESCRIPTION Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HMLs) are disorders involving aberrant myelin formation in the central nervous system. They are clinically characterized by early onset nystagmus, impaired motor development, ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, dysarthria and progressive limb spasticity.  The prototype of primary HMLs is the X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) caused by mutations in PLP1 encoding proteolipid protein lipophilin. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) is clinically similar to classical PMD but is not associated with PLP1 mutations. PMLD appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and mutations have been identified in GJC2, AIMP1, HSPD1 and FAM126A.

NAME        X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA)
DESCRIPTION X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA) is characterized by the combined presentation of weakness and atrophy of postural muscles (scapuloperoneal weakness and bent spine) with a pseudoathletic phenotype where alternative muscle groups are hypertrophic. Linkage studies and haplotype analysis followed by direct gene sequencing have identified five mutations in the FHL1 gene in patients with XMPMA.

NAME        Nemaline myopathy
DESCRIPTION Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. It is characterized by the presence of rods or nemaline bodies, which are red-purple inclusions in myofibers detected by modified Gomori trichrome technique. The hallmark symptoms are generalized muscle weakness with facial involvement or predominant involvement of proximal limb and respiratory muscles. Currently, NM is classified into six different forms: severe congenital (neonatal) form; Amish NM, intermediate congenital form; typical congenital form; childhood-onset form; and adult-onset (late-onset) form. Mutations in six genes, encoding components of the sarcomeric thin filaments, have been identified. Mutations in ACTA1 and NEB nebulin are the most common.

NAME        Central core disease
DESCRIPTION Central core disease (CCD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by central cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. CCD is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but recessive inheritance has been recently described in few families. The clinical phenotype of dominantly inherited CCD is variable but usually mild and non-progressive; however, more severe forms including the fetal akinesia syndrome have also been reported associated with recessive or de novo dominant mutations. CCD typically presents in infancy with hypotonia and motor developmental delay and is characterized by predominantly proximal weakness pronounced in the hip girdle. CCD is due to mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, encoding the principal skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR1). Altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeostasis within muscle cells due to mutation-induced conformational changes of the RyR protein are considered the main pathogenetic mechanisms.

DESCRIPTION Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder defined by numerous centrally placed nuclei on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. CNM exists in the genetic bases of the three main forms: the X-linked recessive form or myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) with severe neonatal phenotype, caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene; the classical autosomal dominant (AD) forms with mild, moderate or severe phenotypes caused by mutations in the DNM2 gene; and an autosomal recessive (AR)  form presenting severe and moderate phenotypes caused by mutations in the BIN1 gene.

NAME        Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD)
DESCRIPTION Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a relatively rare subtype of congenital myopathy characterized by hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness. Pathologic diagnosis of CFTD is based on the presence of type 1 fiber hypotrophy of at least 12% in the absence of other notable pathological findings, in addition to a clinical presentation typical of congenital myopathies. CFTD is a genetically heterogenous condition with X-linked, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations of the ACTA1 and SEPN1 genes have been identified in a small percentage of CFTD cases, and recently mutations in the TPM3 gene were also found to cause CFTD.

NAME        Cap myopathy
DESCRIPTION Cap myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy morphologically characterized by the presence of cap-like structures which are sharply demarcated structures of disorganized thin filaments in the periphery of muscle fibers. These structures are in fact disarranged myofibrils with enlarged Z discs and no thick filaments. The severity of the disease is related to the number of fibers affected. Therefore, patients may present with a neonatal fatal form or have a more stable course of the disease in the infant non-fatal form. Respiratory problems are common. All the currently recognized genes associated with cap myopathy (TPM2, TPM3 and now ACTA1) encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments.

            Hyaline body myopathy
DESCRIPTION Myosin storage myopathy (MSM), also called hyaline body myopathy, is a rare congenital myopathy with variable inheritance characterized by the presence of sub-sarcolemmal hyaline bodies in type I muscle fibers and predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Clinically, patients exhibit variable age of onset ranging from birth through childhood, and occasionally middle age. Symptoms also vary, but typically include slowly progressive muscle hypertonia, scapularperoneal weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. MSM has been associated with 4 missense mutations in the MYH7 gene, which encodes slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MyHC). The disease causing mutations in MYH7 are located in the alpha-helical coiled-coil tail.

NAME        Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD)
DESCRIPTION Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, late-onset muscle disease associated with progressive ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, and unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in skeletal muscle. OPMD is caused by expansions of the short (GCG) trinucleotide repeat in the coding sequence of the poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. To date OPMD is considered as a primary myopathic disorder and there is little morphologic evidence for neurogenic etiology, though the peripheral nervous system (PNS) seems to be affected in some rare cases.

NAME        Myotonia congenita, including:
            Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsen disease);
            Autosomal recessive myotonia congenita (Becker disease);
            Fluctuating myotonia congenita;
            Myotonia levoir
DESCRIPTION Myotonia congenita is a specific inherited disorder of muscle membrane hyperexcitability caused by reduced sarcolemmal chloride conductance due to mutations in CLCN1, the gene coding for the main skeletal muscle chloride channel ClC-1. Impaired functioning of the ClC-1 leads to an increase in sarcolemmal excitability that clinically presents as delayed muscular relaxation (myotonia). Myotonia congenita may be inherited as either an autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease) or recessive trait (Becker disease). The predominant features of Thomsen disease are a painless, transient, muscle stiffness with a predilection for both the upper extremity and the facial muscles. Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita. Like Becker and Thomsen disease, both of these conditions are associated with a defect in the ClC-1. Whether these two entities are truly distinct disorders is under debate, and some propose that they are variants of Thomsen  disease.

DESCRIPTION Erythrokeratoderma variabilis is a rare genodermatosis characterized by both transient, demarcated erythema and persistent hyperkeratosis. Lesions usually appear within the first year of life but may arise later in childhood. Diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma is common. This disease is caused by mutations in GJB3 and GJB4, the genes encoding for connexin channels proteins in the epidermis.

NAME        Russell-Silver syndrome;
            Silver-Russell syndrome
DESCRIPTION Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, relative macrocephaly, a typical triangular face, asymmetry and further less characteristic features. SRS is associated with genetic or epigenetic mutations that affect two different chromosomes. In addition to maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) in 11p15 and maternal duplication of 11p15 have recently been described as major epigenetic disturbances in SRS. The ICR1 regulates expression of the paternally expressed IGF2 and the maternally expressed H19. The H19 gene encodes a 2.3-kb non-coding mRNA, which is strongly expressed during embryogenesis and possibly functions as a microRNA. It has been proposed that H19 hypomethylation leads to biallelic expression of this gene and downregulation of IGF2 expression resulting in growth retardation.

NAME        Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
DESCRIPTION Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth, tumor predisposition, and congenital malformations. It is associated with genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in a cluster of imprinted genes found within a genomic region of approximately one megabase on chromosome 11p15. The imprinted region 11p15 is separated into two domains, with each domain regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control regions (ICR). The centromeric ICR2 regulates the expression of CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and further genes. The majority of cases of BWS show hypomethylation in the ICR2 or mutations in the ICR2-regulated CDKN1C gene. In intron 10 of the KCNQ1 locus, the untranslated KCNQ1OT1 RNA is encoded. KCNQ10T1 is expressed by the paternal allele and probably represses realization of the CDKN1C gene. In the telomeric ICR1, hypermethylation of the H19 promoter and loss of imprinting of IGF2 have been reported in a small fraction of patients with BWS. A few BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations.

NAME        Darier disease;
            Dyskeratosis follicularis
DESCRIPTION Darier disease is an autosomal dominant skin disorder with keratotic papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp, and forehead) and nail abnormalities. The disease usually starts at puberty and characterized by loss of cell-to-cell adhesion and abnormal keratinization. Darier disease is caused by mutations in ATP2A2, the gene encoding a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.

NAME        Sotos syndrome and Weaver syndrome
DESCRIPTION Overgrowth syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from the dysfunction of various processes involving cell proliferation, cell growth, or apoptosis. Within this group, Sotos syndrome is characterised  by overgrowth, multiple congenital anomalies, and developmental delay. Weaver syndrome is characterised by a typical craniofacial appearance, deep set nails, camptodactyly, and advanced carpal osseous maturation. It has been reported that the majority of patients with typical Sotos and Weaver syndrome have intragenic mutations or deletions of NSD1, and thus, represent allelic disorders.

DESCRIPTION Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder of insulin-resistance characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, acanthosis nigricans, lipoatrophy, and genitomegaly. The disease is known as leprechaunism because infants with the disease show an elf-like face and short stature.

NAME        Long QT syndrome, including:
            Romano-Ward syndrome;
            Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS)
DESCRIPTION Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channels. LQTS is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a propensity to torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia frequently leading to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death usually in young otherwise healthy individuals. Anesthesia in a patient with LQTS can trigger malignant arrhythmias and is therefore a high-risk procedure. There are two well-known syndromes with a long QT interval. The Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by an autosomal-dominant inheritance without familial deafness. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) has an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance and is associated with deafness.

NAME        Short QT syndrome
DESCRIPTION Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder resulting from mutations in cardiac ion channels. The mutation of genes (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2) encoding for cardiac potassium channels plays a central role in SQTS. SQTS is characterized by constantly short QT interval associated with atrial fibrillation, syncopal episodes, and sudden cardiac death. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with a short QT syndrome has an increased risk due to possible T wave oversensing.

NAME        Brugada syndrome (BRS)
DESCRIPTION The Brugada syndrome (BRS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Mutations in eight genes (SCN5A, GPD1L, CACNA1C, CACNB2, SCN1B, KCNE3, SCN3B, and HCN4) are known to cause BRS. In approximately 20% of the cases BRS is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel.

NAME        Sick sinus syndrome (SSS);
            Sinus node dysfunction
DESCRIPTION Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness. SSS has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia. Autosomal recessive type (SSS1) can be caused by compound heterozygous mutation in the SCN5A gene, and autosomal dominant type (SSS2) can be caused by heterozygous mutation in the HCN4. SCN5A encodes an alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel carrying the current to form a rapid upstroke of action potential, whereas HCN4 codes for an alpha-subunit of hyperpolarization-activated cation channel.

DESCRIPTION Atrial fibrillation (AF, ATFB) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is regarded generally as a sporadic, acquired disorder. Nevertheless, recent growing evidence points to an important heritable basis for AF. By linkage analysis, several loci have been mapped for monogenetic AF. Some of these loci encode for subunits of potassium channels.

The newborn with this disease show severe hyperkeratosis and scales with fissures over the whole body, pronounced ectropion, and impaired contraction of ears and limbs. HI is associated with truncations/deletions in ABCA12, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters with lipid transporter activity in keratinocytes.

NAME        Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and Non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses comprise a heterogeneous group of skin disorders of hyperkeratosis. Two non-syndromic forms are defined including lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). LI shows more severe phonotype with tight covering of a newborn that is later replaced by large, dark scales. In contrast, NBCIE shows a more pronounced erythroderma with fine, white scaling.

NAME        Ichthyosis vulgaris
DESCRIPTION Ichthyosis vulgaris is one of the most common genetic keratinization disorder characterized by follicular keratosis and grey scaling on the flexor limbs. It is caused by defective synthesis of filaggrin that leads to reduction of keratohyalin granules in epidermis. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

DESCRIPTION Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, also referred to as neutral-lipid-storage disease with ichthyosis, is a rare autosomal recessive disease of lipid metabolism. Cutaneous finding is congenital, generalized ichthyosis similar to that of non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Other characteristics include hepatomegaly, sensorineural deafness, mental retardation, and cataracts. Mutations in the CGI-58 gene encoding a protein of the alpha/beta hydrolase domain subfamily are responsible for this disorder.

NAME        Potassium-aggravated myotonias (PAMs), including:
            Myotonia fluctuans;
            Myotonia permanens;
            Acetazolamide responsive myotonia
DESCRIPTION The potassium-aggravated myotonias (PAMs), which are also known as sodium channel myotonias (SCMs), are a group of pure myotonic disorders caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene. PAMs include three diseases with very similar phenotypes: myotonia fluctuans, myotonia permanens, and acetazolamide-sensitive myotonia. These disorders differ from the other nondystrophic myotonias in that: (1) the myotonia is exacerbated by potassium ingestion; (2) the myotonia does not worsen with cold exposure; and (3) there is no major weakness.

NAME        Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP)
DESCRIPTION The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal-dominant disorders of skeletal muscle sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes. They are characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with variations in serum potassium concentration. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4. However, 20% of cases remain genetically undefined, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. HyperPP is characterized by attacks of flaccid limb paralysis or, rarely, weakness of the eye and throat muscles. Triggers for these attacks include ingestion of potassium-rich food, rest after strenuous exercise, and cold exposure.

NAME        Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP)
DESCRIPTION The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal-dominant disorders of skeletal muscle sodium, potassium, and calcium channel genes. They are characterized by episodes of muscle weakness associated with variations in serum potassium concentration. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is caused by mutations in both the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4, and the homologous alpha1-subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel, Cav1.1. HypoPP is associated with point mutations in both CACNA1S (HypoPP1) and SCN4A (HypoPP2); however, approximately 10-20% of cases remain genetically undefined. In general, HypoPP is characterized by reversible attacks of muscle weakness concomitant with decreased blood potassium concentrations. The attacks may be triggered by rest after strenuous exercise, by a meal rich in carbohydrates, or by exposure to cold. Phenotypic differences between HypoPP1 and HypoPP2 include: (1) earlier onset of disease in HypoPP1; (2) myalgias in HypoPP2; (3) on muscle biopsy, predominance of tubular aggregates in HypoPP2 and vacuoles in HypoPP1; and (4) aggravation of HypoPP2 by acetazolamide.

NAME        Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP)
DESCRIPTION Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP) is characterized by thyrotoxicosis in combination with typical episodes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP). People of Asian descent are most often affected, but all ethnicities can present with TPP. Hypokalemia is typical during paralysis, but is not always detected; administration of potassium during the attacks should be offered cautiously, preferably orally, to prevent rebound hyperkalemia. Mutations have been identified in TPP patients in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, , that is expressed in muscle and transcriptionally regulated by thyroid hormone. Mutations in Kir2.6, which occur in up to 33% of patients, reinforces the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in patients with TPP.

NAME        Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS)
DESCRIPTION Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a distinct type of periodic paralysis characterized in its full form by a triad of cardiac abnormalities, distinctive facial and skeletal features, and periodic paralysis. The distinctive physical features considered characteristic of ATS are: broad forehead, hypoplastic mandible, hypotelorism, low-set ears, digit clinodactyly, and 2-3 syndactyly of the toes. It is obvious that ATS has a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. ATS patients have loss-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the voltage-gated inward rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1. However, described KCNJ2 mutations only account for approximately 60% of diagnoses, suggesting genetic heterogeneity.

NAME        Episodic ataxias
DESCRIPTION Episodic ataxias (EAs) are a group of rare autosomal-dominant diseases characterized by recurrent, discrete episodes of ataxia, giddiness, and vertigo. EA1 and EA2 are the most widely recognized of the autosomal-dominant EAs and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. There are central and peripheral nervous system manifestations in both conditions. The current classification is based on genetics and actually includes seven distinct subtypes. But these variants other than EA1 and EA2 are rare, some only occurring in single families, and gene mutations have not been identified in all. It is quite likely, however, that the number of phenotypes and mutated genes will grow further.

NAME        3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (MGCA)
DESCRIPTION 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (MGCA) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid and 3-methylglutaric acid. Five distinct forms of MGCA have been recognized. MGCA type 1 is caused by primary deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (3-MGCH), resulting in a block of leucine degradation. In all other types, the activities of 3-MGCH and other enzymes of leucine degradation are normal and the MGCA is thought to be secondary to a defect in another pathway. MGCA type 2, also known as Barth syndrome, is an X-linked cardiomyopathy associated with skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth retardation. MGCA type 3, also referred to as Costeff optic atrophy syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene OPA3. It is characterized by early-onset bilateral optic atrophy, later-onset extrapyramidal dysfunction. MGCA type 5 caused by mutation in the DNAJC19 gene, is characterized by early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia, testicular dysgenesis, and growth failure. MGCA type 4 is the unclassified type, which includes all other patients with MGCA.

NAME        Waardenburg syndrome (WS)
DESCRIPTION Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pigment disturbances of the hair, skin, and iris. Four subtypes of WS have been classified based on the presence or absence of additional symptoms. WS 1 and WS 2 are distinguished by the presence or absence of dystopia canthorum, respectively. WS 3 is similar to WS 1 with additional musculoskeletal abnormalities. WS 4 is characterized by the presence of an aganglionic megacolon. WS is associated with six genes of melanocytic differentiation: PAX3, SOX10, MITF, EDNR, EDN3, and SNAIL2.

NAME        Transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn
DESCRIPTION Transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn is a rare disorder in which subepidermal blistering presents at birth. Tissue separation occurs below the lamina densa, due to abnormal intraepidermal accumulation of type VII collagen. The disease usually regresses during early life, as type VII collagen secretion gradually recovers.

            Chromosme 5p deletion syndrome
DESCRIPTION The Cri du Chat syndrome (CdCS) is a genetic disease resulting from a deletion of variable size occurring on the short arm of chromosome 5. The main clinical features are a high-pitched monochromatic cry, microcephaly, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, micrognathia, abnormal dermatoglyphics, and severe psychomotor and mental retardation. SEMAF/ SEMA5A and CTNND2 have been mapped to the critical regions, and their deletion may be associated with mental retardation in CdCS patients. The TERT deletion may contribute to the phenotypic changes in CdCS.

NAME        Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive mental retardation (NS-ARMR)
DESCRIPTION Mental retardation (MR) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotient (IQ) and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Although X-linked MR has been extensively studied, and over 80 causal genes have been cloned, little is known about the genetic basis of nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive mental retardation (NS-ARMR). To date, only a few genes have been identified for NS-ARMR. These include PRSS12, CRBN, CC2D1A, GRIK2, TUSC3, ST3GAL3, and TRAPPC9. These genes have a variety of functions and participate in multiple biochemical pathways. In addition, there are several known disease loci for NS-ARMR for which genes have not yet been identified.

NAME        Hyperekplexia
DESCRIPTION Hyperekplexia, also known as startle disease, is a paroxysmal neurological disorder caused by defects in glycinergic neurotransmission. Hyperekplexia is characterized by neonatal hypertonia and an exaggerated startle reflex in response to acoustic or tactile stimuli. Genetic analysis has revealed mutations in genes for several postsynaptic proteins involved in orchestrating glycinergic neurotransmission, including the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 and beta subunits, gephyrin and collybistin.

NAME        Congenital myasthenic syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogenous group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in several proteins that compose the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) apparatus on which synaptic formation and function depend. The majority are recessively inherited. The disorders of the NMJ cause weakness and fatigue.

NAME        Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM);
            Primary erythromelalgia
DESCRIPTION Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) is characterized by intense episodic burning pain associated with redness and warmth of the affected extremities and in many instances occurs as an autosomal dominant trait. Symptoms of IEM can start as early as 1 year old (early-onset), or in adults (adult-onset), and both types have been described in families and in sporadic cases. Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective, and partial relief of symptoms comes from cooling the affected extremities. Dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, cause IEM.

NAME        Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD)
DESCRIPTION Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD) is a autosomal dominant pain disorder resulting from a set of gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, that impair inactivation of Nav1.7. Severe pain in PEPD patients along with flushing are induced by bowel movement or probing of the perianal areas, and are sometimes accompanied by tonic nonepileptic seizures and cardiac deficits. The pain attacks are most severe in the lower part of the body and are often triggered by temperature changes (such as cold winds), eating, and/or emotional upsets (such as crying).

NAME        Autosomal dominant mental retardation
DESCRIPTION Mental retardation (MR) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotient (IQ) and deficits in adaptive behaviors. Most MR genes identified so far are either located on the X chromosome or are associated with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Only a small number of autosomal dominant MR genes are known, because patients with mental retardation rarely reproduce.

NAME        Nav1.7-associated congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)
DESCRIPTION Nav1.7-associated congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a pure form of CIP affecting only pain sensation and olfaction. A loss-of-function of the SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, can produce CIP. Patients with Nav1.7-related CIP present with a history of not ever experiencing any pain even after burns, bone fractures, lip- and tongue-biting, and they do not experience visceral pain. Additionally, patients with Nav1.7-related CIP do not show apparent sympathetic dysfunction and have a normal axon reflex response to histamine. Homozygous and compound null mutations in SCN9A are predicted to truncate the channel protein, resulting in loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.7 and the complete loss of Nav1.7 current in all of the neurons in which this channel is expressed.

NAME        Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine
DESCRIPTION Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraines (SHM and FHM) are rare paroxysmal disorders characterized by motor aura and headache. The distinction is based on whether at least one first or second degree relative is also affected, otherwise the diagnostic criteria are similar. The majority of FHM families have a mutation in one of the ion channels CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A. SHM is sometimes caused by a de novo mutation in one of the genes. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified.

NAME        Congenital motor nystagmus (CMN);
            Idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN)
DESCRIPTION Nystagmus is an eye movement disorder in which one or both eyes are in constant movement. Nystagmus that occur independent of these known ocular or systemic diseases is referred to as congenital motor nystagmus (CMN) or idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN). It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive, or an X-linked trait. At least six genetic loci for CMN have been suggested, including three loci for autosomal dominant CMN, and three loci for X-linked CMN.  A variety of mutations in the FRMD7 gene have been identified in many families with an X-linked recessive pattern. Another mutation associated with X-linked CMN is GPR143.

DESCRIPTION Spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-hand type, or spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-abnormal calcification type is a rare skeletal dysplasia. The key clinical features of this condition include short stature with typical short hands and broad, puffy fingers, a narrow chest, and a characteristic craniofacial appearance. Their long bones are short due to premature epiphyses and irregular metaphyses.

NAME        Usher syndrome (US)
DESCRIPTION Usher syndrome (USH) is a group of autosomal recessively inherited disorders characterized by deafness and vision loss. Three clinical types USH1, USH2, and USH3, are distinguished on the basis of severity of hearing loss and the presence or absence of vestibular dysfunction. USH1 patients are congenitally profoundly deaf, and have vestibular dysfunction as well as prepubertal onset of progressive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). USH2 is characterized by congenital mild hearing impairment with normal vestibular responses. USH3 is characterized by a progressive hearing loss, a variable vestibular dysfunction, and RP. USH shows significant genetic heterogeneity, and at least 11 distinct loci have been identified and genes for 9 of them have been cloned.

            Dravet syndrome/ Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI)
DESCRIPTION Febrile seizures (FS), or febrile convulsions (FEB), are acute symptomatic seizures that occur in response to fever and represent the most common form of childhood seizures. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a familial epilepsy syndrome with a spectrum of phenotypes including FS. Severe epilepsy phenotypes such as Dravet syndrome (SMEI) have also been described within GEFS+ families. A significant genetic component exists for susceptibility to FS and GEFS+. Extensive genetic studies have shown that at least ten loci are responsible for FS. Furthermore, mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit genes (SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN1B) and the GABA(A) receptor subunit genes (GABRG2 and GABRD) have been identified in GEFS+.

DESCRIPTION Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp (HSS) is a rare autosomal dominant genotrichosis that affects men and women equally. It is characterized by progressing hair loss from the middle of the first decade, culminating in an almost complete loss of scalp hair by the third decade. CDSN, a keratinocyte adhesion glycoprotein is responsible for the disease.

ENTRY       H00787                      Disease
NAME        Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), including:
            CSNB type 1 (CSNB1);
            CSNB type 2 (CSNB2);
            CSNB autosomal dominant (CSNBAD);
            Oguchi disease/ CSNB Oguchi type (CSNBO)
DESCRIPTION Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a group of nonprogressive retinal disorders characterized by impaired night vision. CSNB is currently associated with X-linked genes (NYX, CACNA1F), autosomal recessive genes (CABP4, GRK1, GRM6, SAG, TRPM1), and autosomal dominant genes (GNAT1, PDE6B, RHO). Two types of CSNB can be distinguished by use of the standard flash electroretinogram (ERG). CSNB type 1 (CSNB1) is characterized by the complete absence of rod pathway function, whereas CSNB type 2 (CSNB2) is caused by impaired rod and cone pathway function. Oguchi disease is a form of CSNB. Patients with the Oguchi disease have a unique yellowish-gold fundus that regains its normal color after prolonged dark adaptation. That is called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon.

NAME        Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP)
DESCRIPTION Porokeratosis is a disorder of keratinization characterized by atrophic patches surrounded by a ridge of keratin called cornoid lamella. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common form of porokeratosis. It is induced by exposure to ultraviolet light and usually appears during the third or fourth decade.

NAME        Aromatase excess syndrome
DESCRIPTION Aromatase excess syndrome (AEXS) is a rare disorder characterized by gynecomastia. Excessive expression of aromatase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the estrogen biosynthesis, causes pre- or peripubertal onset gynecomastia, advanced bone age such as early fusion of epiphyses, and short stature in affected males. Female patients experience premature breast development.

DESCRIPTION Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve characterized by paresthesias in the district of the median nerve. Familial carpal tunnel syndrome is an extremely rare form with bilateral symptom that is frequently associated with inherited systemic disorders such as mucopolysaccharidosis, mucolipidosis, amyloidosis, collagen vascular disease or hereditary liability to pressure palsies. The cause of the disease is the compression of the median nerve by thickened transverse carpal ligament. Mutations in transthyretin, a gene that plays a role in deposition of amyloid, have been reported.

DESCRIPTION CEDNIK (Cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratoderma) syndrome is a rare condition that shows severe developmental failure of the nervous system and the epidermis. Clinical manifestations include microcephaly, cerebral dysgenesis, facial dysmorphism, palmoplantar keratoderma, and ichthyosis. Decreased expression of SNAP29, a member of the SNARE family of proteins, is linked to abnormal lamellar granule maturation and abnormal epidermal differentiation.

DESCRIPTION Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arterial aneurysms and dissections, pectus excavatum, craniosynostosis, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, and thin, translucent skin. LDS results from mutations in the TGF beta receptor genes.  LDS has been subdivided in LDS1 and LDS2 on the basis of the presence or the absence of craniofacial involvement, respectively. LDS3 is associated with early-onset osteoarthritis and caused by mutation in the SMAD3 gene. LDS4 is caused by mutation in the TGFB2 gene.

NAME        Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD);
            Aortic aneurysm familial thoracic type (AAT)
DESCRIPTION Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are the major diseases that affect the thoracic aorta. While majority of the cases are sporadic, more than 20% are inherited as a single gene disorder. Familial TAAD is diagnosed based on the presence of dilatation and/or dissection of the thoracic aorta, absence of clinical features of Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and presence of a positive family history of TAAD. TGFBR2, TGFBR1, MYH11, ACTA2, and two loci on other chromosomes, AAT1 and AAT2, are associated with familial TAAD.

            Brittle cornea syndrome (EDS6B);
            EDS-like spondylocheiro dysplasia (SCD-EDS)
DESCRIPTION Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders, characterized by abnormal collagen synthesis, affecting skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and other organs. Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibrillar collagens type I, III and V, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of these collagens. EDS can be classified  into six major types: classical type, hypermobility type, vascular type, kyphoscoliosis type, arthrochalasia type and dermatospraxis type. Additional minor variants of EDS have been identified with molecular and biochemical abnormalities: cardiac valvular form, musculocontractural type, progeroid form, tenascin-X deficiency, Brittle cornea syndrome, and EDS-like spondylocheiro dysplasia.

            Enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS);
            Autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC)
DESCRIPTION The inherited vitreoretinal degenerations are disorders of the eye characterized by early onset cataract, anomalies of the vitreous manifesting as optically empty vitreous, course fibrils, and membranes, and retinal detachment. These diseases include Stickler syndrome types I (STL1) and II (STL2), caused by mutations in COL2A1 and COL11A1 respectively. Snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD) is associated with a mutation in a KCNJ13, and Wagner syndrome (WGN1) with mutations in CSPG2. Knobloch syndrome (KNO) may also be caused by mutations in a collagen gene, COL18A1. In addition to Stickler syndrome and other chondrodysplasias, enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) are associated with vitreoretinal degeneration.

NAME        Benign familial neonatal and infantile epilepsies, including:
            Benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE);
            Benign familial neonatal infantile epilepsy (BFNIE);
            Benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE)
DESCRIPTION Benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), benign familial neonatal infantile epilepsy (BFNIE), and benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE) are three benign epilepsy syndromes with autosomal dominant inheritance distinguished by ascending average ages of seizure onset (mean age at onset of 2-3 days; 11 weeks; and 6 months, respectively). They are a group of genetic (idiopathic) epilepsies which have a primary genetic background, usually no structural brain abnormalities and most of them have a benign course without additional neurological symptoms. For BFNE and BFNIE, genetic defects have already been identified. Whereas BFNE are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the two genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encoding the voltage-gated K+ channels Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, mutations in the gene SCN2A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.2 have been detected in BFNIE. There are as yet no known genes identified for BFIE.

NAME        Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE);
            Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by nocturnal, frequent, brief and stereotypic seizures that include explosive onset, screaming, agitation, stiffening, kicking or bicycling of the legs, and incontinence. Ictal video electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed partial seizures originating from the frontal lobe but also in parts of the insula, suggesting a defect of a broader network. Mutations in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2, which encodes the alpha4-, beta2-, and alpha2-subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, have been reported. These mutations are concentrated in the pore-forming M2 transmembrane segments.

NAME        Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), including:
            Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE);
            Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE);
            Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME);

            Familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (FIME)
DESCRIPTION Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are the most common types of epilepsy in childhood and adolescence. Based on the main seizure type and age at onset, four classic subsyndromes exist: childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. Although autosomal dominant inheritance occurs in rare families, clinical genetic data indicate that complex inheritance involving two or more genes is likely in the majority of families.

NAME        Autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy (ADTLE);
            Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is an inherited epilepsy syndrome characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood of lateral temporal seizures with predominant auditory symptoms originating from the lateral temporal lobe cortex. Mutations in the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene have been reported in up to 50% of ADTLE/ADPEAF pedigrees. In addition, de novo LGI1 mutations are found in about 2% of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with ADLTE/ADPEAF but have no family history.

NAME        Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME/ EPM), including:
            Lafora disease (LBD);
            Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD);
            Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL);
            Type I sialidosis;
            Action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (DRPLA);
            Type III Gaucher disease (GD)
DESCRIPTION Progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) is a syndrome complex characterized by progressive myoclonus, cognitive impairment, ataxia, and other neurologic deficits. PME is a disease that afflicts previously normal children with ever-worsening and soon-intractable myoclonus and epilepsy, usually associated with neurodegeneration, and eventual dementia and early death. PME include Lafora disease (LBD), Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), type I sialidosis (cherry-red spot myoclonus), action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF/DRPLA), and type III Gaucher disease (GD). Almost all the autosomal recessively inherited PMEs are lysosomal diseases, with the exception of Lafora disease in which neither the accumulating material nor the gene products are in lysosomes. PME also occurs in various forms of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, especially in myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF).

NAME        Distal arthrogryposis (DA)
DESCRIPTION Distal arthrogryposis (DA) are a distinct group of syndromes with congenital contractures primarily involving the hands and feet, which often are associated with abnormal facies, and are transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. To date, 10 different DA syndromes have been characterized and classified. DA2A and DA2B are also referred to as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Sheldon-Hall syndrome, respectively. DA1, DA2A, DA2B, and DA7 are caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins of the contractile apparatus of the fast-twitch myofibers including TNNI2, TNNT3, MYH8, MYH3, and TPM2.

NAME        Trichomoniasis
DESCRIPTION Trichomoniasis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection caused by a motile flagellate protozoan parasite. An estimated 160 million people are annually infected. Women with trichomoniasis have a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from a relatively asymptomatic state in one-third of cases to severe irritation and inflammation. Several complications associated with adverse pregnancy outcome have been reported.

NAME        Agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN)
DESCRIPTION Agenesis of the corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It is associated with mental retardation, progressive peripheral neuropathy caused by axonal degeneration, and complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. ACCPN is found in French Canadian population and could be resulted from a single founder mutation.

DESCRIPTION Stargardt disease (STGD) is the most common type of hereditary macular dystrophy. It is characterized by decreased central vision, atrophy of the macula and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and frequent presence of prominent flecks in the posterior pole of the retina. Histopathologically, eyes with STGD reveal abnormal accumulations of lipofuscin in the RPE. To date, mutations in four genes have been identified as causing STGD, including ABCA4, ELOVL4, PROM1, and CNGB3.

NAME        Macular degeneration, including:
            Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD);
            Patterned dystrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (PDREP);
            Retinal macular dystrophy 2 (MCDR2);
            X-linked atrophic macular degeneration (MDXLA)
DESCRIPTION Macular degeneration is the physical breakdown of the central portion of the retina called the macula. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD/ARMD) is the leading cause of blindness. AMD is a complex disease caused by the combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Using genome linkage scan and association studies, multiple potentially causative genes have been identified. In AMD, there are two phenotypes, atrophic/ dry and neovascular/ wet. The former is characterized by the geographic atrophy due to death of retinal pigment epithelium, and the latter is usually characterized by the abnormal growth of new blood vessels under the macula, which causes severe loss of vision. While wet AMD can be treated by the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor or photodynamic therapy, so far there are no available treatments for dry AMD.

NAME        Renal agenesis and Renal adysplasia
DESCRIPTION Renal agenesis and renal adysplasia are congenital defects of kidney development. Renal agenesis can be unilateral/bilateral with no kidneys or very little kidney present. Renal adysplasia is a condition in which kidneys begin to form but contain undifferentiated tissues. Sometimes the hypoplastic tissues regress. These diseases can lead to childhood end-stage renal failure.

NAME        Familial flecked retina syndrome, including:
            Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina (DHRD);
            Basal laminar drusen (BLD);
            Fundus albipunctatus (FA);
            Retinitis punctata albescens (RPA);
            Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy  (BCD)
DESCRIPTION The flecked retina syndrome is characterized by multiple deep, yellow to yellowish white fundus lesions of variable size and shape in eyes without vascular or optic nerve disease. Originally this group consisted of four diseases: fundus albipunctatus, fundus flavimaculatus, familial drusen and fleck retina of Kandori. Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina (DHRD) and Basal laminar drusen (BLD) are included in familial drusen. However, there are far more diseases with fleck-like deposits in the retina, including primary hereditary ocular diseases such as retinitis punctata albescens (RPA) or Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (BCD), neuro-ophthalmologic syndromes such as Kjellin's syndrome, and secundary retinal flecks due to metabolic disorders.

NAME        Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES)
DESCRIPTION Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease. The cardinal feature of this disease is a complex eyelid/ocular malformation such as blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. The horizontal shortening of the palpebral aperture can lead to amblyopia. It is caused by mutations in FOXL2 gene that is involved in palpebral and ovarian development. Some of the female patients have premature ovarian failure (POF) and this condition is classified as BPES type I. BPES with normal ovarian function is referred to as BPES type II.

NAME        Primary dystonia
DESCRIPTION Dystonias are a heterogeneous group of hyperkinetic movement disorders characterized by involuntary sustained muscle contractions that lead to abnormal postures and repetitive movements. Presently, 20 distinct monogenic primary dystonias have been recognized. They can be divided into Primary torsin dystonias (PTDs), dystonia-plus syndromes without brain degeneration, dystonia-parkinsonism 
            with brain degeneration (i.e. DYT3), and paroxysmal dyskinesias.

ENTRY       H00833                      Disease
NAME        Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA);
            Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome;
            Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN);
            Neuroferritinopathy;
            Aceruloplasminemia
DESCRIPTION Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of progressive extrapyramidal and cognitive disorders characterized by iron accumulation predominantly in the globus pallidus, as well as extensive axonal spheroids in various regions of the brain. The most frequent genetic form is the pantothenate kinase-2 associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) with a mutation in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene. Other forms are associated with a mutation in phosphoslipase A2 (PLA2G6), FTL (neuroferritinopathy), CP (aceruloplasminemia), FA2H (Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase) and ATP13A2 (ATPase type 13A2) genes. A significant proportion of children with an NBIA phenotype have no genetic diagnosis and there are additional as yet undiscovered genes that account for a number of these cases.

NAME        Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of creatine biosynthesis caused by a deficiency of hepatic guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, resulting in a lack of creatine and an accumulation of guanidinoacetic acid, the precursor of creatine. GAMT deficiency is characterized by developmental arrest or delay in the first few months of life with epilepsy and extrapyramidal movements as common features. Neurologic signs and symptoms are variable, and autistic spectrum disorders are sometimes seen in older affected individuals. Pathophysiology of GAMT deficiency is thought that the accumulation of guanidinoacetate can interact with neuronal GABAA receptors and cause the neurological dysfunction which underlies these symptoms.

NAME        Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency;
            4-Hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-HBA)
DESCRIPTION Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, also known as 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-HBA), is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism. Clinical features include intellectual disability with prominent deficits in expressive language, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia, and hyporeflexia. The causative gene is aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1 (ALDH5A1) encoding SSADH. SSADH is deficient in affected individuals impairing the formation of succinic acid from succinic semialdehyde and leading to the increased production of 4-HBA.

DESCRIPTION GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) is an autosomal dominant or recessive inborn error of glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. The majority of patients carry mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the GLUT1 transporter. Defects in the GLUT1 result in low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels termed hypoglycorrhachia. Affected individuals present with mental retardation and learning disabilities; also common are ataxia, dystonia, seizures, and acquired microcephaly.

DESCRIPTION Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a heterogeneous group of severe retinal degenerations, which typically becomes evident in the first year of life. Affected infants have little or no retinal photoreceptor function as tested by electroretinography. LCA is generally inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and caused by mutations in more than a dozen genes. Several have been demonstrated as potentially efficacious gene therapy targets.

NAME        Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM)
DESCRIPTION Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) describes a group of rare congenital eye movement disorders that result from the dysfunction of all or part of the oculomotor (CN 3) and the trochlear (CN 4) nerves, and/or the muscles these nerves innervate. CFEOM is characterized by non-progressive, restrictive ophthalmoplegia of the extraocular muscles and congenital blepharoptosis. Three clinical phenotypes for familial CFEOM (CFEOM1, 2, and 3) have been delineated.

NAME        Familial amyloidosis
DESCRIPTION The amyloidoses are a group of diseases in which proteins that are normally soluble deposit extracellularly in tissues as insoluble fibrils. The fibrils have a characteristic beta-pleated sheet configuration that renders them avid for Congo red dye. In the familial amyloidoses, a gene mutation inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner results in a single amino acid substitution that renders a plasma protein amyloidogenic. Mutations in the TTR gene are the most common cause of familial amyloidosis. The clinical features of familial amyloidosis vary depending on the underlying amyloidogenic protein and the particular amino acid affected by the mutation, ranging from peripheral and autonomic neuropathy to cardiomyopathy.

NAME        Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome;
            Ulna and fibula, absence of, with sever limb deficiency
DESCRIPTION Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome is a limb malformation disorder that has overlapping phenotype with Fuhrmann syndrome, but more-severe limb truncation is observed. This is due to complete loss of WNT7A function in Al-Awadi/Raas-Rothschild syndrome whereas impairment is partial in Fuhrmann syndrome.

NAME        Ataxia with ocular apraxia (AOA), including:
            Ataxia telangiectasia (AT);
            Ataxia telangiectasia like disorder (ATLD);
            Ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1);
            Ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2)
DESCRIPTION Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) is a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias mainly characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and choreoathetosis. AOA includes ataxia telangiectasia (AT), ataxia telangiectasia like disorder (ATLD), ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). AT, ATLD, and AOA1 are due to homozygous mutations in genes encoding a protein involved in DNA repair. Ophthalmic features of AT include conjunctival telangiectasia, strabismus, saccadic dysfunction with head thrusts, and convergence insufficiency. AOA1 is typically characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and late axonal sensori-motor neuropathy. The gene mutated in AOA2, SETX, encodes senataxin, a putative DNA/RNA helicase which has been shown to play a role in the response to oxidative stress.

DESCRIPTION Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is a rare disorder characterized by congenital fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. Scoliosis, mirror movements, otolaryngological, kidney, ocular, cranial, limb, and/or digit anomalies are often associated. It has been reported that KFS is caused by mutations in the GDF6 or GDF3 genes in an autosomal dominant manner. Although KFS is also inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, the gene involved is unknown.

DESCRIPTION Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder also known as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Two different categories of WFS (WFS1 and 2) are recognized, each with its own subset of variable symptoms, and resulting from mutations in the WFS1 and CISD2 genes, respectively. The WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-embedded protein. ERIS, the protein that CISD2 encodes, also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum.

NAME        Triphalangeal thumb, including:
            Triphalangeal thumb;
            Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome
DESCRIPTION Triphalangeal thumb (TPT) is a rare human hand-foot malformation characterized by a long, finger-like thumb with three phalanges. It can occur either in isolated form or in association with other defects such as triphalangeal thumb-polydactyly syndrome (TPT-PS). TPT is caused by defects in a cis-regulatory sequence ZRS, located in intron 5 of LMBR1, which is crucial for expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) during limb development.

NAME        Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN)
DESCRIPTION Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that share the common feature of a length-dependent predominantly motor neuropathy. Many forms of dHMN have minor sensory abnormalities and/or a significant upper-motor-neuron component, and there is often an overlap with the axonal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) [DS:H00264] and with juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [DS:H00058] and hereditary spastic paraplegia [DS:H00266]. The causative genes with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked patterns of inheritance have implicated proteins with diverse functions.

NAME        Benign hereditary chorea
DESCRIPTION Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) is a rare, autosomal dominant, static disorder characterized by onset of chorea in conjunction with hypothyroidism and respiratory problems. Features supporting this diagnosis include normal general examination with no dysmorphic features, broadly normal intellectual development with no regression or loss of cognitive skills, absence of other significant neurologic disturbances, and, with the exception of chorea, normal neurologic examination findings. Mutations in the TTF1 gene  encoding the thyroid transcription factor-1 have been identified in a number of BHC patients, suggesting that aberration of TTF1 transcriptional function or haploinsufficiency is associated with this disorder. TTF1, belonging to the NKX2 homeodomain transcription factor family, has been implicated in several important molecular pathways essential for brain, thyroid and lung morphogenesis.

NAME        Tourette syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic motor and vocal tics. Rare functional variants in the neuronal transmembrane molecule SLITRK1 have been associated with TS. The SLITRK1 gene is expressed in brain regions and it appears to play a role in dendritic growth. Another possible rare genetic cause of TS is a mutation in the HDC gene. The HDC gene encodes for L-histidine decarboxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of histamine from histidine.

NAME        Lethal congenital contractural syndrome (LCCS)
DESCRIPTION Lethal congenital contractural syndrome (LCCS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by congenital nonprogressive joint contractures with a severe form of arthrogryposis. LCCS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It has a worldwide incidence, but it is more common in isolated populations, such as Finland and the Bedouin community in Israel. Mutations in GLE1, ERBB3, and PIP5K1C are associated with LCCS.

            Vanishing white matter disease;
            Childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH);
            Cree leukoencephalopathy (CLE)
DESCRIPTION Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), also referred to as childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH), is one of the most prevalent inherited childhood disorders of cerebral white matter. This autosomal recessive progressive neurological disorder usually begins in early childhood, but a wide spectrum of clinical severity is now recognized from fatal infantile forms such as Cree leukoencephalopathy to mild later-onset forms associated with ovarian failure. The principal findings are cerebellar ataxia and spasticity with relative preservation of mental abilities. The course is typically relapsing-remitting with progressive neurological deterioration leading to death in the second decade of life. Nearly all patients have mutations in any of the 5 genes encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B. Mutated eIF2B could impair the ability of cells to regulate protein synthesis, especially under conditions of cell stress. Reduced levels of eIF2 activity as occurs in VWM may lead to activation of the unfolded protein response inducing both prosurvival and proapoptotic signals affecting oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in particular.

ENTRY       H00875                      Disease
NAME        Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC)
DESCRIPTION Megalencephaiic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by macrocephaly and a slowly progressive clinical course marked by spasticity and cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral extensive white-matter changes with cysts in the temporal regions. Based on the clinical and MRI features, MLC can be distinguished from other conditions (ie, Alexander disease [DS:H00065], Canavan disease [DS:H00074], glutaric acidemia type I [DS:H00178]) that present in infancy with megalencephaly. An autosomal recessive mutations in the MLC1 gene have been shown to cause this condition. Recently, mutations in HEPACAM gene are reported to be associated with MLC.

NAME        Mismatch repair deficiency, including:
            Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC);
            Lynch syndrome;
            Muir-Torre syndrome;
            Turcot syndrome
DESCRIPTION Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is a condition associated with DNA mismatch repair mutations. MMR deficiency is correlated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and some forms of sporadic tumors. HNPCC also referred to as Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant-inherited disorder characterized by predisposition to colorectal cancer and extracolonic malignancies, frequent multiple primary tumors in the same patient, and early age of cancer onset. A clinical variant of Lynch syndrome, Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is characterized by the association between one or more visceral malignancies, with at least one sebaceous skin tumor or keratoacanthoma. Turcot syndrome is characterized by the concurrence of primary brain tumors and colon cancers and/or multiple colorectal adenomas.

NAME        Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly
DESCRIPTION Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly is an autosomal recessive infantile-onset neurological disorder. The affected individuals are asymptomatic at birth and show a static encephalopathy with normo- or microcephaly and psychomotor impairment within the first year of life. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral anterior temporal lobe cystic lesions and enlarged inferior horns combined with multifocal white matter alterations. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the RNASET2 glycoprotein lead to this disorder.

NAME        Perry syndrome
DESCRIPTION Perry syndrome is a rapidly progressive, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder. The cardinal symptoms consist of parkinsonism, depression, severe weight loss and hypoventilation. At a molecular level, Perry syndrome is characterized by TDP-43 inclusions indicating a pathological overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and some forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Perry syndrome has recently been identified as being due to mutations in the DCTN1 gene, encoding the component of the dynactin complex.

DESCRIPTION Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial clustering of early onset tumors including sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas (ADR). Initially considered as a rare syndrome, LFS and its variants are increasingly recognized as one of the most frequent and diverse forms of predisposition to cancer. Most cases identified and characterized to date are associated with dominantly inherited germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (p53). In a subset of non-p53 patients with LFS, CHEK2 has been identified as another predisposing locus. LFS is diagnosed on the basis of the confirmed clinical diagnostic criteria.

DESCRIPTION Cocoon syndrome is an autosomal recessive lethal syndrome characterized by multiple fetal malformations, the most obvious anomalies being the defective face and seemingly absent limbs, which are bound to the trunk and encased under the skin. It has been reported that defects in CHUK are the cause of cocoon syndrome. CHUK has an essential role in the development of skin epidermis and its derivatives, along with various other morphogenetic events.

DESCRIPTION Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized histologically by infiltration of periodic acid Schiff-positive hyaline material into the skin, upper aerodigestive tract, and internal organs. Infantile hoarseness is a common presenting feature of the disease due to infiltration of larynx. In two-thirds of the cases, voice changes are present at birth or in early infancy as the first manifestation. The disorder has been shown to result from loss-of-function mutations in the extracellular matrix protein 1 gene. The function of the protein extracellular matrix protein 1 gene is still unclear.

DESCRIPTION Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of multiple anomalies resulting from mutations in the LRP2 gene. It is characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, typical craniofacial features (ocular hypertelorism, enlarged fontanelle), ophthalmological abnormalities (high myopia, iris stromal hypoplasia), severe sensorineural deafness, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and proteinuria. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of mutations in LRP2.

DESCRIPTION Azoospermia is a disorder in which there is a complete absence of sperm in the semen. It is classified as obstructive azoospermia caused by problems with sperm transport and nonobstructive azoospermia caused by failure of spermatogenesis. Y-linked gene USP9Y has been implicated in moderate oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and azoospermia. SYCP3 mutations lead to complete infertility due to meiotic arrest.

DESCRIPTION Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (COXPD) is a group of multisystem disorders with variable manifestations resulting from a defect in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. It has been reported that the mutations in the ribosomal protein gene (MRPS16 and MRPS22) cause severe antenatal-onset infantile disease. The patients with COXPD caused by mutations in mitochondrial translation elongation factor genes (GFM1, TUFM, TSFM and C12orf65) have also been reported.

NAME        FG syndrome (FGS);
            Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome
DESCRIPTION FG syndrome (FGS), also known as Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, is a rare X-linked multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation (MCA/MR) disorder characterized by high clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity. The cardinal features of the syndrome are congenital hypotonia, delayed development of speech, relative macrocephaly (as compared to height and weight), anal anomalies or severe constipation, and dysmorphic facial features. Five loci have so far been linked to this phenotype on the X chromosome. A recurrent missense mutation in the MED12 gene has been identified as the cause for the subset of FGS cases. Filamin A gene (FLNA) and CASK gene mutations could be another causes of FG syndrome.

NAME        Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
DESCRIPTION Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease, primarily affecting women. Abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) within the lung is responsible for cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma and leads to chronic respiratory failure. Another characteristic feature of the disease is the development of fluid-filled lymphatic cystic structures (lymphangioleiomyomas) in the axial lymphatics and of angiomyolipomas in the kidneys. Its presentation is sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, a dominant autosomal neurocutaneous syndrome. Both disorders have their origin in mutations of the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 and TSC2, which are involved in the regulation of cell signs critical for energy control and cell nutrition processes.

NAME        Pontocerebellar hypoplasia
DESCRIPTION Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a group of inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorders with prenatal onset. Up to now seven different subtypes have been reported. All subtypes share common characteristics, including hypoplasia/atrophy of cerebellum and pons, progressive microcephaly, and variable cerebral involvement. Mutations in three tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit genes were found to be responsible for PCH2, PCH4 and PCH5. Mutations in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial arginyl- tRNA synthetase gene underlie PCH6. PCH1 is caused by homozygous mutation in the VRK1 gene.

            Mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia;
            Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML)
DESCRIPTION Myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia (MLASA) is a rare autosomal recessive oxidative phosphorylation disorder specific to skeletal muscle and bone marrow. MLASA has been associated with a missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1), an enzyme located in both nucleus and mitochondria, which converts uridine into pseudouridine in several cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNA positions and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis in both compartments. Recentry, it has been reported that a mutation of the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene, YARS2, also causes MLASA. Myopathy with succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase deficiency has been found to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iron-sulphur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU). ISCU is essential for the activity mitochondrial iron-sulphur proteins such as succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase.

NAME        Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI)
DESCRIPTION Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited aminoaciduria caused by defective cationic amino acid transport at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in intestine and kidney. Patients affected by this disorder, in general, come to medical attention from early on in life with several significant problems including failure to thrive and intellectual impairment. LPI is caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, which encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, the catalytic light chain subunit of a complex belonging to the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family.

NAME        Cystinuria
DESCRIPTION Cystinuria is a inherited disorder of re-absorptive transport of cystine and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, arginine and lysine in the proximal tubule and small intestine. Diagnostically, urinary levels of dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine, and most prominently, of cystine are constantly elevated. Plasma levels of these amino acids in general are at the lower end of the normal range. Patients with cystinuria often present with nephro- or urolithiasis at almost at any age with a clear preference in childhood due to elevated urinary cystine. Early diagnosis is important, as it allows prevention or diminution of kidney stones. Mutations in either interacting subunit SLC3A1 (rBAT) or SLC7A9 (b0,+AT) cause cystinuria. Cystinuria due to mutations in SLC3A1 is an autosomal recessive trait, whereas mutations in SLC7A9 can be seen as an autosomal dominant trait.

NAME        Congenital clubfoot;
            Congenital talipes equinovarus
DESCRIPTION Congenital clubfoot is an idiopathic deformity of the lower limb that consists of malalignment of the bones and joints of the foot and ankle. It is defined as a fixation of the foot in a hand-like orientation. The calcaneus, navicular and cuboid bones are medially rotated in relation to talus. PITX1 haploinsufficiency accounts for the disease by causing developmental field defect during embryogenesis.

NAME        Iminoglycinuria
DESCRIPTION Iminoglycinuria is a benign condition characterized by the excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and glycine in the urine. The disorder is of autosomal recessive inheritance and is genetically complex. Inactivation or reduced function of SLC36A2 (PAT-2) is the predominant determinant of the iminoglycinuria phenotype in humans. Mutations in SLC6A20 (SIT-1) and SLC6A19 (B0AT1) could also be the cause.

DESCRIPTION Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a relatively common cause of intestinal obstruction in the newborn. It is characterized by absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel and extending proximally for varying distances. Recently, several genes have been identified to be associated with HD. The functions of the gene products include transcription factors regulating gene expression in neural crest cells and in participants in signaling pathways between intestinal mesenchymal cells and neural crest cells.

DESCRIPTION Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria (DA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a striking excretion of urinary glutamate and aspartate, resulting from the incomplete reabsorption of anionic amino acids from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. DA is generally considered to be a benign disorder, but cases with mental retardation have been reported as well. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC1A1 could be associated with DA.

NAME        Choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress
DESCRIPTION Choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress is a syndrome of congenital hypothyroidism associated with pulmonary problems, mental retardation, muscular hypotonia and persistent ataxia which could be described as choreoathetosis. This disorder is attributed to mutations of the NKX2.1, a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the developing thyroid, respiratory epithelium, and specific areas of the forebrain during embrypgenesis.

NAME        Warsaw breakage syndrome
DESCRIPTION Warsaw breakage syndrome is a cohesinopathy characterized by cellular defects in sister chromatid cohesion and hypersensitivity to agents that induce replication stress. It is caused by defective DDX11/ChlR1, a XPD helicase family member. In Warsaw breakage syndrome, features of Fanconi anemia (chromosomal breakage) and Roberts syndrome (sister chromatid cohesion defects) coexist, and individuals with this disorder show severe microcephaly, facial dysmorphy, pre- and post- natal growth retardation, and abnormal skin pigmentation.

NAME        Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC);
            Bourneville-Pringle disease
DESCRIPTION Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), also known as Bourneville-Pringle disease, is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder characterized by pervasive benign tumors in most organ systems including the brain, skin, kidney, liver, lung, and heart, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with TSC are frequently diagnosed with comorbid neurological disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioral dysregulation, sleep disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). TSC most often results from spontaneous genetic mutations in one or two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These gene products form a physical and functional complex to limit activation of the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. When these genes are deficient, mTOR complex 1 is constitutively up-regulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and protein synthesis.

NAME        Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)
DESCRIPTION Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder characterized by an idiopathic failure of the automatic control of breathing. It is frequently associated with a broad spectrum of dysautonomic symptoms, suggesting the involvement of genes widely expressed in the autonomic nervous system. In particular, the ASCL1-PHOX2A-PHOX2B developmental cascade was proposed as a candidate pathway. Recently, It has been showed that PHOX2B is the major CCHS locus, whose mutation accounts for 60% of cases.

NAME        Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs)
DESCRIPTION Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare hereditary disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and by distinct morphological abnormalities of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. Non-erythroid hematopoietic cell lineages are morphologically normal. Three types of the disease are known as type I, II and III, and there is also a huge group of congenital forms that cannot be included with any of the three canonical types. CDA type II is the most widely spread form. CDA type III is the rarest of the three classical types of CDA and both familial and sporadic cases have been reported. Responsible genes for type I (CDAN1) and type II (SEC23B) have been identified.

DESCRIPTION Conotruncal heart malformations comprise a group of clinically significant congenital heart defects. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a condition in which the aorta rises from the right ventricle and is associated with ventricular septal defect. Persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) is a failure of division of the cardiac outflow tract into the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Conotruncal anomaly face syndrome is characterised by many abnormalities, including cardiac outflow tract anomalies, nasal voice, and facial dysmorphism.

NAME        Arterial tortuosity syndrome
DESCRIPTION Arterial tortuosity syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tortuosity, elongation, stenosis and aneurysm formation in the large and medium-sized arteries with defective elastic fibers of the arterial wall. Other features of this disease are characteristic face and several connective tissue manifestations. It has been speculated that arterial tortuosity syndrome is caused by the upregulation of TGF-beta signaling that stimulates vessel wall cell proliferation, but other mechanism involving disturbed transport of ascorbate, a cofactor for collagen and elastin hydroxylases, has been proposed recently.

            NHEJ1 syndrome
DESCRIPTION Severe combined immunodeficiency with microcephaly, growth retardation, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation is a syndrome associated with T and B cell-combined lymphocytopenia, growth retardation, microcephaly, and increased cellular radiosensitivity. Mutations in human NHEJ1 can lead to lymphocytopenia due to its role in V(D)J recombination in the immune system. This disease shows features common with the ones observed in LIG4 deficiency or Nijmegen breakage syndrome.

NAME        Hereditary pancreatitis;
            Hereditary chronic pancreatitis
DESCRIPTION Hereditary pancreatitis is a very rare form of chronic relapsing pancreatitis.  Its inheritance mode is autosomal dominant with an incomplete penetrance (80%). Patients had recurrent pancreatitis with impairment of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function, maldigestion, bile duct and duodenal obstruction, and rarely pancreatic cancer. The age of onset is early and differs from the cases of non-hereditary pancreatitis.

ENTRY       H00934                      Disease
NAME        Caudal duplication anomaly
DESCRIPTION Caudal duplication anomaly is a rare type of developmental disorder that arises from incomplete separation of mono-ovular twins. It can involve various congenital anomalies, but the hallmark is duplication of organs in the caudal region, and most frequently affected organs are genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Recently AXIN1 promotor has been shown to have methylation in patients with caudal duplication anomaly.

NAME        Cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS) and Crisponi syndrome (CRISPS)
DESCRIPTION Cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS) and Crisponi syndrome (CRISPS) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Mutations in CRLF1 account for about 90% and mutations in CLCF1 account for about 10% of CISS and CRISPS. CRISPS is characterized by congenital muscular contractions of facial muscles, with trismus in response to stimuli, dysmorphic features, bilateral camptodactyly, major feeding and respiratory difficulties, and access of hyperthermia leading to death in the first months of life. CISS is characterized by profuse sweating induced by cool surroundings.

DESCRIPTION Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome is a rare disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the kinesin binding protein (KBP) and is characterized by central and enteric nervous system defects. Clinical features of this syndrome include polymicrogyria, mild mental retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, and short-segment Hirschsprung disease. The precise function of KBP is largely unclear, but it is required for cell differentiation and neurite development.

NAME        Precocious puberty, including:
            Central precocious puberty (CEPREPU);
            Familial male precocious puberty (FMPP)
DESCRIPTION Precocious puberty has been classically defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics in girls younger than 8 years old and in boys younger than 9 and a half years old. Central precocious puberty (CEPREPU) refers to a gonadotropin-dependent type which results from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). CEPREPU is much more frequent in girls than in boys (up to 20:1 ratio). Recently, kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) and its ligand, kisspeptin, were revealed as major gatekeepers of puberty onset. Mutations of the KISS1R gene were described in patients with impaired pubertal development. On the other hand, it has been reported that heterozygous mutations of the LHCGR gene cause gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males, but have no detectable effects on prepubertal or postpubertal females.

DESCRIPTION G6PC3 deficiency is a syndromic variant of severe congenital neutropenia associated by complex organ malformation. Patients often have cardiac defects such as atrial septal defects, an increased superficial venous marking, and urogenital malformations. In the absence of G6PC3, increased ER stress makes neutrophils prone to undergo apoptosis and leads to defective organ development.

NAME        Cohen syndrome
DESCRIPTION Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with a broad phenotypic spectrum. Essential symptoms include mental retardation, progressive postnatal microcephaly, typical facial anomalies, ophthalmologic findings such as chorioretinal dystrophy and myopia, and granulocytopenia. Obesity and growth delay could be observed. In most patients, Cohen syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the COH1 gene.

DESCRIPTION Factor XII (FXII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Although FXII deficiency is not associated with a clinical bleeding tendency, FXII is an important protease that plays a major role in the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Venous or arterial thrombosis, recurrent miscarriages, and placental abruption were reported in cases with FXII deficiency.

NAME        TARP syndrome
DESCRIPTION TARP syndrome is a disorder marked by early lethality. It comprises Talipes equinovarus, atrial septal defect, Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate), and persistence of the left superior vena cava. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Expression analysis of mouse orthologue of the causative gene revealed that the gene is expressed in the parts where malformations in TARP syndrome are observed, such as in the branchial arches and in the limb/tail bud regions.

NAME        Factor XIII deficiency
DESCRIPTION Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective cross-linking of fibrin and poor resistance to fibrinolysis. The severity of the bleeding tendency varies from benign symptoms like excessive bruising to life threatening bleeding emergencies such as intracranial hemorrhages. In plasma, FXIII circulates as a pro-transglutaminase composed of two catalytic A subunits and two non-catalytic B subunits. Symptoms that are almost pathognomonic for A subunit deficiency are umbilical bleeding in the neonatal period and repeated fetal wastage in pregnant females.

NAME        Renal hypouricemia (RHUC)
DESCRIPTION Renal hypouricemia (RHUC) is a disorder characterized by impaired uric acid reabsorption at the apical membrane of proximal renal tubule cells, and high urinary urate excretion. Renal urate reabsorption is controlled via two proximal tubular urate transporters: apical URAT1 (SLC22A12) and basolateral GLUT9 (SLC2A9). And it has been suggested that RHUC is caused by mutations in URAT1 or GLUT9. Most of patients were asymptomatic, but some had nephrolithiasis or were predisposed to exercise-induced acute renal failure.

NAME        Focal dermal hypoplasia;
            Goltz-Gorlin syndrome
DESCRIPTION Focal dermal hypoplasia, also known as Goltz-Gorlin syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant disorder characterized by patchy dermal hypoplasia and fat herniation through skin in combination with skeletal, ocular and dental abnormalities. Skeletal dysplasia consisting of syndactyly, polydactyly, camptodactyly or ectrodactyly and ocular anomalies such as colobomas, microphthalmia or cataract are frequently reported. Mutations in the PORCN gene has been shown to cause the disease.

NAME        Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD);
            Corneal dystrophy of Bowman's type I;
            Granular corneal dystrophy type III
DESCRIPTION Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD) is a progressive autosomal dominant dystrophy and patients are born with normal appearing corneas. In the first or second decade of life, corneal opacification and scarring cause marked visual loss and recurrent corneal erosions lead to significant pain. In RBCD, Bowman's membrane is disrupted or absent and instead is replaced by a fibrocellular tissue with deposition of rodlike bodies best seen with the electron microscope. Thiel-Behnke dystrophies (TBCD) share many similarities as well as some differences with RBCD. Both RBCD and TBCD are linked to mutations in the TGFBI gene.

DESCRIPTION Thiel-Behnke dystrophy (TBCD) is an autosomal dominant dystrophy with recurrent corneal erosions developing in the first and second decade of life. TBCD shares many similarities with Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD), but decreasing visual acuity is seen later than with RBCD. Electron microscopy reveals curly fibers deposited in Bowman's layer and this finding differentiates it from RBCD. Both TBCD and RBCD are linked to mutations in the TGFBI gene. TBCD is also linked to a mutation on chromosome 10q23-24, the gene product is currently unknown.

NAME        Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDCD);
            Subepithelial amyloidosis;
            Primary familial amyloidosis
DESCRIPTION Gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDCD) is a rare autosomal recessive dystrophy characterized by multiple prominent milky-white gelatinous mulberry-shaped nodules formed beneath the corneal epithelium during the first decade of life. Clinical symptoms include photophobia, foreign body sensation, and decreased vision. Fusiform deposits similar to those in lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) may also form in the deeper stroma. GDCD has been linked to mutations in the TACSTD2 gene. TACSTD2 is a cell surface phosphoglycoprotein as well as a substrate for protein kinase C. Mutations in the gene lead to a truncated protein which is thought to trigger amyloid formation in the cornea.

NAME        Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD);
            Corneal dystrophy Groenouw type II;
            Fehr corneal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, is the least common but severe form of stromal dystrophy characterized by superficial gray-white corneal opacities that progressively increase to involve the entire corneal stroma from limbus to limbus. Patients experience progressive decreased vision and irritation as the diseases worsens, and will have vision severely affected by the third to fourth decade of life. It has been shown that a specific sulfation step in the production of keratan sulfate, the major glycosaminoglycan of the corneal stroma, is impaired in MCD. This results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans that form the abnormal deposits. Mutations in the CHST6 gene, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfation of keratan sulfate, are responsible for most cases of MCD.

            Granular-lattice dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Granular dystrophy (GCD), inherited in an autosomal dominant fasion, is one of the most common corneal dystrophies characterized by the deposition of gray-white crumb like opacities in the anterior stroma that slowly increase in number and progress into deeper parts of the cornea. The disease is typically asymptomatic, but can present with pain from recurrent erosions and decreased vision. Opacities in granular dystrophy are composed of eosinophilic hyaline deposits. Differences in the clinical appearance of the discrete corneal opacities permit to divide into types of GCD; Type I classic form of GCD, type II Avellino or granular-lattice type, and type III Reis-Bucklers type. GCD has been linked to several mutations in TGFBI gene.

DESCRIPTION Lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), the most common of the stromal cornea dystrophies, is an autosomal dominant dystrophy with variable expression. Clinical findings include the presence of a linear network of subepithelial opacities (lattice lines). Clinically and histologically there are several types of two genetically distinct inherited LCD so far. One with no systemic manifestations is caused by specific mutations in the TGFBI gene (LCD type I and its variants); the other resulting from a mutation in the GSN gene (LCD type II) has systemic manifestations.

NAME        Fleck corneal dystrophy (FCD);
            Francois-Neetens speckled corneal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Fleck corneal dystrophy (FCD) is a rare corneal dystrophy characterized by multiple asymptomatic, non-progressive symmetric minute flecks disseminated throughout the corneal stroma. FCD does not affect vision and does not require treatment, but mild photophobia has been reported. Histopathology of the affected areas showed that the flecks correspond to areas of swollen keratocytes with cytoplasmic vesicles that contain lipids and mucopolysaccharides. FCD has been associated with mutations in the PIP5K3 gene encoding for an enzyme with a dual specificity that has both protein and lipid kinase activity.

            Congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy;
            Witschel dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD) is a rare condition characterized by numerous opaque flaky or feathery clouding of the corneal stroma. The flakes and spots become more numerous with age and are slowly progressive to decrease the visual acuity. In CSCD, the morphologic abnormalities include a peculiar arrangement of tightly packed lamellae having highly aligned collagen fibrils of an unusually small diameter. Refractive error, photophobia, strabismus and resulting amblyopia with searching nystagmus are common in affected individuals. CSCD is linked with mutations in the decorin gene, which encodes for a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan.

NAME        Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD);
            Schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy (SCCD);
            Crystalline stromal dystrophy;
            Schnyder crystalline dystrophy sine crystals
DESCRIPTION Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is a corneal dystrophy that is characterized by deposition of cholesterol in the corneal stroma. SCD usually becomes apparent early in life with corneal clouding or with crystals within the corneal stroma. Over time, an initially unremarkable corneal stroma acquires small white opacities and a diffuse haze. In approximately 50% of cases, crystals are not evident clinically (Schnyder crystalline dystrophy sine crystals). Most cases of SCD lack an obvious systemic disorder, but hypercholesterolemia is common, and so are associated manifestations, such as arcus lipoides and xanthelasma. An opaque disc of corneal crystals or other lipids may diminish vision sufficiently in both eyes to result in the need for a corneal graft. SCD is caused by one of numerous mutations in the UBIAD1 gene.

NAME        Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FECD);
            Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy
DESCRIPTION Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is characterized by progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells, thickening of Descemet membrane, and deposition of extracellular matrix in the form of guttae. As a result, the endothelial layer is eventually no longer able to support corneal deturgescence, leading to corneal edema and decreased in visual acuity. These findings usually become clinically evident in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Corneal transplantation is currently the only modality used to restore vision. FECD is a genetically complex disorder, but the familial risk is relatively high. Candidate gene studies of COL8A2, solute carrier family 4, sodium borate transporter, member 11 (SLC4A11), and transcription factor 8 (TCF8) have found mixed evidence for potentially causal variants.

NAME        Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD)
DESCRIPTION Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is a very rare, bilateral autosomal dominant disorder affecting primarily the innermost corneal layers, Descemet membrane (DM), and the endothelium, biomicroscopically presenting as geographical lesions, bands, and vesicles. It primarily affects the corneal endothelium to produce epithelial-like transformation and irregular thickening of DM due to the deposition of an abnormal collagenous layer. Most cases are static, but occasionally rapid progression can result in severe visual disability from secondary glaucoma or corneal edema. Three genes have been reported as causing PPCD: VSX1 associated with PPCD1, COL8A2 responsible for PPCD2, and ZEB1 shown to cause PPCD3. The contribution of changes in VSX1 and COL8A2 to the pathogenesis of this dystrophy is considered to be minor compared to ZEB1.

NAME        RIDDLE syndrome
DESCRIPTION RIDDLE (radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, dysmorphic features, and learning difficulties) syndrome is an immunodeficiency disorder that primarily manifests as an immunoglobulin deficiency. The underlying genetic cause of this syndrome is defective RNF168 that functions to recruit DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins, such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, to sites of DNA damage. As with patients with other DSB repair disorders, the RIDDLE patients also present with nonimmunological characteristics including short stature and motor control problems.

            Corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness (CDPD);
            Harboyan syndrome
DESCRIPTION Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a rare inheritable disorder of the corneal endothelium characterized by bilateral symmetric corneal clouding (edema) with varied severity from mild opacification to milky, ground-glass opacification without other anterior segment abnormalities, usually evident at birth or in the early years of life. Two subtypes of CHED based on differences in the mode of inheritance are known, an autosomal dominant (CHED1) and an autosomal recessive (CHED2) type. Clinically, both forms of the disorder are similar; the distinction between them is made by the age at onset and the presence or absence of associated symptoms. Both CHED1 and CHED2 have been mapped to chromosome 20. The Solute Carrier family 4 (sodium borate cotransporter) member 11 (SLC4A11) has been identified as the candidate gene for CHED2. Mutations in SLC4A11 are described in Harboyan syndrome, which is characterized as CHED2 with hearing loss. Most patients with CHED have severe visual impairment and often require penetrating keratoplasty.

NAME        Raine syndrome;
            Lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia
DESCRIPTION Raine syndrome or lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized osteosclerosis and characteristic facial dysmorphism. Death in the neonatal period is due to respiratory failure. Radiographic studies have shown generalized increase in the density of all bones and the basal structures of the skull, which leads to the characteristic facial features including microcephaly, proptosis, hypoplastic nose and midface, small jaw, and cleft palate.

DESCRIPTION Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis is a very rare progressive paralytic disorder characterized by increasing weakness and stiffness of muscles in the arms, legs and face. Although primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a sporadic disorder of adult middle age, this disease is also observed in children as JSPS. JSPS arises from dysfunction of the upper motoneurons and the causative gene is ALS2.

DESCRIPTION Achromatopsia is an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy with a prevalence of 1 in 33,000 individuals. It is characterized by low visual aquity, photophobia, nystagmus, difficulty in color discrimination, and no recordable cone function in electroretinography with normal rod functions. The condition is caused by genetic defects affecting the cone ion channels (CNGA3 and CNGB3) or transducin (GNAT2) which are crucial components of the cone photoreceptor signaling.

NAME        Rotaviral enteritis;

DESCRIPTION Rotavirus is the most important cause of acute infantile gastroenteritis and causes 611 000 deaths worldwide each year. Infections have been reported to occur repeatedly in humans and most of cases in adults are asymptomatic. Infections in young children lead to acute diarrhea. Symptoms of rotavirus infection are non-specific and include vomiting and diarrhoea, occasionally accompanied by a low grade fever. Dehydration occurs in 40 to 80% of patients and is the most common cause of death. Viral NSP4 enterotoxin is responsible to the diarrhoea by eliciting calcium mobilization in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.

NAME        Colorblindness, including:
            Dichromacy;
            Anomalous trichromacy
DESCRIPTION Colorblindness is the inability or decreased ability to perceive color differences. Dichromacy is a condition characterized by reduced dimension of color vision in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. Anomalous trichromacy is the milder form of color vision deficiency, with ability to discriminate between different colors in varying degrees but not normal. Dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy are subdivided into three types: protan, deuten, and tritan depending on the affected cone type. Protan and deuten types consist red-green defects. Inherited red-green color vision defects affect 8% of males. Tritan type defect leads to inherited blue-yellow defect that is fairly rare.

NAME        Trichorhinophalangeal dysplasia, including:
            Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type I (TRPS1);
            Langer-Giedion Syndrome (TRPS2);
            Sugio-Kajii Syndrome (TRPS3)
DESCRIPTION Trichorhinophalangeal syndromes (TRPS) is a rare peripheral dystosis with mainly autosomal dominant inheritance. Three different forms of TRPS are known: type I (TRPS1), type II (TRPS2) and type III (TRPS3). They are characterized by sparse hair, bulbous pear-shaped nose, long and flat philtrum, thin upper lip, and protruding ears. Skeletal abnormalities that are frequently observed include epiphyses of the middle phalanges with shortened metacarpals, hip malformations, and short stature. The causative gene is TRPS1 that was shown to be a regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in mouse.

NAME        Thrombocytopenia (THC);
            Familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM)
DESCRIPTION Thrombocytopenia is defined by a decrease in the number of platelets in circulating blood, resulting in the potential for increased bleeding and decreased ability for clotting. Inherited syndromes are relatively rare causes of thrombocytopenia, but some genes underlying these disorders have been elucidated. Some inherited syndromes predispose to the development of bone marrow failure or leukemia. For example, familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM) is characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects, and propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukemia.

NAME        Caudal regression syndrome and Sirenomelia
DESCRIPTION Caudal dysgenesis and sirenomelia are rare malformations that represent a spectrum of caudal anomalies. Clinical findings include varying degrees of agenesis of the vertebral column (usually sacral or lumbosacral spine), as well as anorectal and genitourinary anomalies. The most severe end of this spectrum is known as sirenomelia that is characterized by fused lower limbs. These are caused by developmental field defects of blastogenesis involving the caudal mesoderm and usually sporadic.

DESCRIPTION Bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a rare recessive genetic immune disorder endorsed by a partial or complete absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression. BLS could be grouped as Type I, Type II and Type III based on defective surface MHC expression. The mutations in the TAP subunits are one of the most common features of BLS type I. MHC I deficiency due to tapasin (TAPBP) deficiency was also discovered recently.

NAME        Bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) type2
DESCRIPTION Bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a rare recessive genetic immune disorder endorsed by a partial or complete absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression. BLS could be grouped as type I, type II, and type III based on defective surface MHC expression. A feature of loss in constitutive and inducible MHC II proteins have been grouped as BLS type II. The abnormality of the transcription factors, which combine to form a singular transcription complex essential for the initiation of the transcription of MHC II, contributes to the development of BLS type II. BLS type III is recognized by the loss of both MHC I and MHC II molecules.

NAME        Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS);
            Pena-Shokeir syndrome, type 1
DESCRIPTION Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired fetal movement and resulting developmental defects. Fetal movement is essential for normal fetal development and growth. Intrauterine movement restriction causes growth retardation, congenital limb contractures, pterygia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and hydramnios.

NAME        Familial skewed X-chromosome inactivation
DESCRIPTION X chromosome inactivation is the transcriptional silencing of the majority of genes on one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian females that equalizes the effective dosage of X-linked genes between XX females and XY males. Therefore mammalian females are mosaics for two cell populations with different X chromosomes active. Skewed X inactivation is defined as a pattern where the cells show a preferential inactivation of one X chromosome. The incidence of skewing is shown to be age dependent but in general, skewing does not have any biologic consequence. However, in cases of individuals with nonlethal mutated allele, degree of skewing is predisposing to genetic diseases such as hemophilia A. The key player is the X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST), an X-linked untranslated RNA that coats the inactive X-chromosome.

NAME        Combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (VKCFD)
DESCRIPTION Combined vitamin K-dependent clotting factors deficiency (VKCFD) is a rare congenital bleeding disorder consisting of a deficiency of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X , as well as the coagulation inhibitors protein C, protein S, and protein Z. VKCFD leads to a bleeding tendency with a variegate clinical picture. Two subtypes have been identified, deriving from mutations of two enzymes of the vitamin K cycle. VKCFD type1 is defined by defective GGCX activity, while VKCFD type 2 derives from functional deficiency of VKORC.

NAME        CATSHL syndrome
DESCRIPTION CATSHL syndrome is characterised by camptodactyly, tall stature, scoliosis, and hearing loss. The syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the FGFR3 gene. FGFR3 is a negative regulator of bone growth, and its mutations are well known to cause a variety of short-limbed bone dysplasias and craniosynostosis syndromes. The finding of CATSHL syndrome indicates that abnormal FGFR3 signaling can cause human anomalies by promoting as well as inhibiting endochondral bone growth.

NAME        Hereditary angioedema
DESCRIPTION Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder, manifested by recurrent episodes of angioedema localized to the skin or mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract or larynx. The laryngeal angioedema is potentially lethal. The classic forms, HAE types I and II, result from deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Type I HAE is caused by decreased expression of C1INH in the plasma whereas type 2 HAE, consisting approximately 15% of patients with HAE, is due to expression of a dysfunctional C1INH protein. HAE type III has been observed exclusively in women and appears to be correlated with high estrogen levels.

NAME        Choroid plexus papilloma
DESCRIPTION Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare intraventricular papillary neoplasms of neuroectodermal origin, accounting for less than 1% of all intracranial tumors and 2-4% of pediatric brain tumors. CPTs are categorized by three distinct histologies; choroid plexus papilloma, atypical choroid plexus papilloma, and the malignant choroid plexus carcinoma. Choroid plexus papillomas outnumber choroid plexus carcinomas and are composed of a single layer of cuboidal-to-columnar cells, resting on a basement membrane overlying papillary and vascularized connective tissue.

            Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOPS)
DESCRIPTION The C syndrome/ Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome is characterized by trigonocephaly and associated anomalies, such as unusual facies, psychomotor retardation, redundant skin, joint and limb abnormalities, and visceral anomalies. The C syndrome is caused by mutations in CD96, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Because of close similarity between both syndromes, Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOPS) is considered the more severe form of the C syndrome, therefore known as C-like syndrome. Recently, It has been reported that de novo nonsense mutations in ASXL1 cause BOPS.

DESCRIPTION Occult macular dystrophy (OMD) is an inherited or sporadic macular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of macular function but normal ophthalmoscopic appearance. Patients with OMD have normal full-field electroretinograms (ERGs), but the focal macular ERGs (FMERGs) and multifocal ERGs are abnormal. OMD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, patients with sporadic disease have been also reported. Mutations in RP1L1 gene, which plays essential roles in the cone functions, are responsible for OMD.

DESCRIPTION Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (IAD) is a rare disease characterized by low plasma ACTH and cortisol levels and preservation of all other pituitary hormones, that may be an underestimated cause of neonatal death. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the human TPIT (TBX19) gene were detected in IAD. TPIT is a T-box transcription factor with a specific role in differentiation of the corticotroph lineage. It has been reported that TPIT mutations are responsible for two thirds of neonatal-onset complete IAD but can not be detected in partial or late-onset IAD.

NAME        Adult i phenotype
DESCRIPTION Adult i phenotype is a rare autosomal recessive condition that was found to be highly associated with congenital cataract. The I and i antigens are carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface of a variety of tissues and body fluids. Most adult red blood cells (RBCs) abundantly express I antigen. Conversion of the i antigen into an I structure takes place during the first 18 months after birth as a result of the expression of a specific transferase, I-branching GCNT2. Lack of this enzyme results in the adult i phenotype.

DESCRIPTION Human sparganosis is caused by larval form (spargana) of the canine/feline tapeworms belonging to the genus Spirometra. A wide range of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals serve as second intermediate/paratenic hosts. Humans become infected by drinking contaminated water, eating undercooked meat of infected frogs or snakes, or by applying poultices of frog or snake flesh on open wounds in traditional medical treatment in parts of southeast Asia. Spargana invade the brain, eyes, spinal cord, breast, and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in blindness, paralysis, and even death.

NAME        Primary bile acid malabsorption
DESCRIPTION This disease occurs when there is impaired absorption of bile acids in the terminal ileum. In patients with terminal ileal resection or impaired terminal ileal function, bile acids are not reabsorbed and excess colonic bile acids cause diarrhea. Excess colonic bile acids can be seen in patients with a histological normal terminal ileum and this has been called primary bile acid malabsorption.

NAME        Choanal atresia and lymphedema
DESCRIPTION Choanal atresia and lymphoedema is a rare congenital malformation caused by loss-of-function mutation in PTPN14 encoding a nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase. PTPN14 has been shown to interact with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is essential for lymphangiogenesis. The mechanism responsible for the development of chanal atresia is not clear but believed to be failure of the breakdown of the bucconasal membrane during embryogenesis.

NAME        Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
DESCRIPTION Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a highly lethal form of inherited primary electrical myocardial disease characterized by exercise- and stress-related adrenergic ventricular tachycardia without structural cardiac abnormalities. It manifests as syncope and sudden death and can be caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) accounting for an autosomal dominant form (CPVT1) or mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene CASQ2 accounting for an autosomal recessive form (CPVT2). It was also reported that absence of the inhibitory G-Protein Galphai2 predisposes to ventricular tachycardia.

NAME        Optic atrophy (OPA)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary optic atrophy (OPA) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a sudden or gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells function. OPA results from degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. Symptoms include a variable association of decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, and color vision abnormalities. All nonsyndromic OPAs characterized to date result from defects in genes encoding mitochondria-related proteins. The most frequent forms of nonsyndromic OPA are autosomal dominant OPA1-linked OPA (OPA1) and mitochondrial DNA-linked, maternally inherited Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). By contrast, autosomal recessive forms of optic atrophies (arOAs) are less frequent, and most cases are syndromic (e.g., OPA3 or Type III 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and OPA7). Isolated or nonsyndromic arOAs are believed to be extremely rare.

NAME        Rhodococcus equi infection
DESCRIPTION Rhodococcus equi is an aerobic, gram-positive bacillus. Rhodococcus equi infection is rare in humans, but it can cause potentially fatal disease in immunocompromised patients. The clinical spectrum of R. equi infection is broad and pulmonary involvement is a predominant feature in most cases. The characteristic pathological findings, termed malakoplakia that comprises a dense infiltration of foamy histiocytes with intracellular coccobacilli and scattered concentric basophilic inclusions, are observed in biopsy specimens of R. equi infection.

            Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency;
            Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (AKGDH) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Diseases of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) constitute a group of rare human diseases that affect core mitochondrial metabolism. The Fumarase deficiency is caused by impairment of the fumarate hydratase enzyme. The symptoms of the disorder include developmental delay, severe mental retardation, language impairment, seizures and dysmorphic facial features. The succinate dehydrogenase deficiency affects mitochondrial complex II, which links the TCA cycle with the electron transport chain. The phenotype is highly variable and can include Leigh syndrome, leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and mental and motor skill deterioration. The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency is extremely rare and characterised by encephalopathy and hyperlactatemia resulting in death in early childhood.

NAME        Familial adenomatous polyposis
DESCRIPTION Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds to thousands of adenomas throughout in the rectum and colon. If left untreated, all patients with FAP develop colon cancer a decade after the appearance of the polyps. The genetic defect in FAP is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. In a subset of individuals, a MUTYH mutation causes a recessively inherited polyposis condition.

NAME        Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M)
DESCRIPTION Anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia (A/M) can be defined as an absence or reduced size of the globe in the orbit. Anophthalmia refers to complete absence of the globe in the presence of ocular adnexae. Microphthalmia is defined as a globe with a total axial length that is at least two standard deviations below the mean for age. Coloboma, or a defect in the closure of the choroid fissure, is most common ocular malformation associated with microphthalmia. Coloboma is considered to be part of the A/M spectrum. A/M can be isolated, associated other anomalies or part of a well defined syndrome. A/M have complex aetiology with chromosomal, monogenic and environmental causes identified.

NAME        Cornea plana congenita
DESCRIPTION Cornea plana congenita is a rare hereditary anomaly in which the normal protrusion of the cornea from the sclera is missing. Clinical features include hyperopia, slight microcornea, an extended limbus zone, and arcus lipoides seen even before the age of 20. Cornea plana congenita occurs in a mild autosomal dominant (CNA1) and a more severe autosomal recessive (CNA2) form. CNA2 has a high prevalence in the Finnish population due to strong founder effect.

            Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
DESCRIPTION Orthostatic intolerance (OI) or postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system primarily affecting young females, and is characterized by lightheadedness, palpitations, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope primarily occurring with upright posture and being relieved by lying down. Patients often have high plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in relation to sympathetic outflow on standing. Abnormal norepinephrine transporter (NET) function is considered to contribute to the pathophysiology in some patients with OI. The impaired uptake of NE could be caused by a mutation in the SLC6A2 gene that encodes the NET.

NAME        N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency
DESCRIPTION N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism affecting ammonia detoxification in the urea cycle. The N-acetylglutamate is the absolutely required allosteric activator of the first urea cycle enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). In defects of NAGS, the urea cycle function can be severely affected resulting in fatal hyperammonemia in neonatal patients or at any later stage in life. Clinical features of NAGS deficiency include poor feeding, vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, and coma.

NAME        Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens
DESCRIPTION The condition of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) causes obstructive azoospermia frequently seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) that is characterized by progressive lung disease, pancreatic dysfunction, elevated sweat electrolytes, and male infertility. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene are linked to these diseases.

NAME        Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
DESCRIPTION Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is typically an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction (OI) occurring during the luteal phase or early pregnancy. OHSS is characterised by a cystic enlargement of the ovaries and an acute fluid shift from the intravascular to the third space, which may result in ascites, pleural infusions, pericardial infusion, and even generalized edema. Majority of OHSS cases have been associated with the use of gonadotrophins for OI in anovulatory women or for ovarian stimulation (OS) in the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Recurrent cases and familial occurrence of OHSS have been described, and different mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHr) have been reported in these cases. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) appears to be the major predisposing factor for OHSS in a large number of studies.

NAME        Dracunculiasis;
            Guinea worm disease
DESCRIPTION Dracunculiasis, or guinea worm disease, is a parasitic disease caused by the nematode Dracunculiasis medinensis. It affects mostly remote rural communities that do not have access to safe drinking water. It is transmitted by contaminated drinking water containing water fleas that are infected with D. medinensis larvae. In infected individuals, the worm emerges as a whitish filament in the center of a painful ulcer of lower extremity, impairing mobility for up to 8 weeks.

NAME        Schistosomiasis
DESCRIPTION Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the genus Schistosoma parasites. Schistosomiasis is the third most devastating tropical disease in the world and WHO estimates 600 million people at risk of infection with 200 million infected. Among nonimmune patients, host's immune response to schistosome eggs leads to acute schistosomiasis that is characterized by cercarial dermatitis and 'Katayama fever'. Life-threatening cardiac and neurological complications may occur. Schistosome eggs can also leads to chronic fibrotic response in host tissues, causing gastrointestinal and liver diseases.

DESCRIPTION Trichuriasis is a parasitic disease caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. It infects 600-800 million people globally especially in tropical areas, with the highest intensity of infection being in children aged 5-15 years. Adult trichuris whipworms live in the large intestine (caecum and colon) and cause chronic dysentery and/or rectal prolapse.

NAME        Cysticercosis
DESCRIPTION Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, is endemic in many poorer countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia where pigs are raised. Human infection with T. solium occurs after ingestion of undercooked pork infected with cysticerci. Infection of the human nervous system by T. solium (neurocysticercosis) causes acquired epilepsy and death. Ophthalmic cysticercosis is much less common than neurocysticercosis (occurring in 1-3% of all infections).

DESCRIPTION Liver fluke is a chronic parasitic inflammatory disease mostly reported from South America, Africa, Australia, Mediterranean countries, Germany, England, and China where endemic animal illness is observed. Infection of humans occurs through the ingestion of contaminated freshwater fish. Acute stage of this disease consists of fever, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Chronic inflammation due to the settlement of C. sinensis and O. viverrini in the small intrahepatic bile ducts contributes to serious secondary complications such as cholangiocarcinoma.

NAME        Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
DESCRIPTION Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an uncommon intravascular hemolytic anemia that results from the clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutations in an X-linked gene, termed PIG-A. PIG-A is required for the biosynthesis of a lipid moiety, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. PIG-A mutations block GPI anchor biosynthesis, resulting in a deficiency or absence of all GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. This deficiency on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis since certain GPI anchored proteins normally function as complement regulators.

NAME        Pediculosis, including:
            Head lice infestation;
            Body lice infestation
DESCRIPTION Pediculosis is the result of infestation by one of two distinctly different families of sucking lice, the Pediculidae and the Pthiridae. Both of them produce equivalent disorders, with itching, bites, and nits on the hairs. Head louse infestation is one of the most frequently occurring parasitic diseases in children, crossing all social and geographic boundaries. Body lice preferentially affect the displaced. They are major vectors of diseases such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.

            Covert toxocariasis;
            Common toxocariasis
DESCRIPTION Human toxocariasis is the disease caused by infection of zoonotic roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati, whose definitive hosts are dogs and cats, respectively. Humans become infected by ingesting either embryonated eggs from soil or raw vegetables. Toxocara larval migration in the body can cause four clinical syndromes, namely visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and covert/common toxocariasis. These are frequently associated with fever, abdominal pain, cough, wheeze, and hepatomegaly. Ocular larva migrans can lead to visual loss.

NAME        Gnathostomiasis
DESCRIPTION Gnathostomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the helminths Gnathostoma species, which are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. Humans usually become infected by eating raw freshwater fish. The clinical presentation is characterized by localized, intermittent, migratory swellings of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, often in association with localized pain, pruritus, and erythema.

NAME        Anisakiasis
DESCRIPTION Anisakiasis is an acute gastrointestinal disease caused by infection with the larval stages of herring worm (Anisakis spp.) or the cod worm (Pseudoterranova decipiens). Humans can be accidental hosts by consuming raw or undercooked fish. Anisakiasis occurs through the world, with over 90% cases are from Japan. After ingestion, larvae penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa and there is severe abdominal pain, with nausea and vomiting. Some patients develop syndromes exhibiting clinical manifestations of allergy.

DESCRIPTION Babesiosis is a malaria-like infection of red blood cells caused by the protozoan parasite Babesia species. It is a well-recognized veterinary disease in cattle, horses and dogs but recently has gained attention as an emerging zoonotic disease problem. Babesia are transmitted by ixodid ticks and infection of the host leads to anemia, hyperbilirubinuria, hemoglobinuria, and possibly organ failure.

NAME        Human metapneumovirus infection
DESCRIPTION Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an emerging human respiratory pathogen first reported in 2001. hMPV is widely distributed that nearly all individuals have been exposed to the virus by age of 5 years. It causes mild to severe cough, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia and these symptoms cannot be distinguished from those caused by the respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses.

NAME        Pentosuria
DESCRIPTION Pentosuria is an autosomal recessive inherited condition to be inborn errors of metabolism characterized by high levels of the pentose sugar L-xylulose in blood and urine. The condition is completely clinically benign. Mutations have been identified in the DCXR gene encoding L-xylulose reductase, which are predicted to lead to loss of enzyme activity. In pentosuria, failure to convert L-xylulose to xylitol leads to accumulation of L-xylulose.

NAME        Acute alcohol sensitivity
DESCRIPTION Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are important enzymes that eliminate toxic aldehydes by catalysing their oxidation to non-reactive acids. It is reported that a deficiency in the ALDH2 is associated with the alcohol flush reaction. More than 40% of the East Asians population carries a common ALDH2 mutant allele, which results in a dramatic reduction in the enzymatic activity when compared with the wild-type allele.

NAME        Peters anomaly, including:
            Peters plus syndrome;
            Peters anomaly plus systemic features
DESCRIPTION Peters anomaly is a developmental disorder that presents with central corneal opacity (leukoma), iris and lenticular adhesions to the cornea, and lack of the posterior corneal stroma, and Descemets membrane. Approximately half of patients develop glaucoma. The majority of cases are sporadic; however, autosomal recessive and dominant patterns of inheritance have been found. Specific chromosomal abnormalities have also been found to be responsible for Peters anomaly.

            PHGDH Deficiency
DESCRIPTION 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the synthesis of the amino acid L-serine characterized clinically by congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and infantile onset of intractable seizures. The biochemical abnormalities associated with this disorder are low concentrations of L-serine, D-serine, and glycine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Mutations have been identified in PHGDH, the gene encoding 3-PGDH.

ENTRY       H01086                      Disease
NAME        Lymphatic filariasis
DESCRIPTION Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic nematode infection that is endemic in 81 countries worldwide with 1.2 billion people at risk and an estimated 120 million infected, especially in tropical regions. Wuchereria bancrofti accounts for 91% of the cases while Brugia malayi and B. timori (which has a distribution restricted to South and Southeast Asia) infections account for the other 9%. Disease pathogenesis is linked to host inflammation invoked by the death of the adult parasite, manifesting as recurrent debilitating fevers, hydrocoeles, lymphangitis and lymphadenitis, and elephantiasis.

NAME        Balantidiasis;
            Balantidial dysentery
DESCRIPTION Balantidium coli is the only ciliated protozoon known to infect humans. B. coli is acquired by humans via the fecal-oral route from the natural reservoir, pigs. Humans may remain asymptomatic or may develop dysentery due to the ulcerations in the colon which can become secondarily infected by intestinal bacteria. Balantidiosis is mostly restricted to tropical/subtropical regions where people live in close proximity to their livestock.

NAME        Pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy (PPCA)
DESCRIPTION Pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy (PPCRA) is a rare retinal disorder characterized by the presence of bilaterally symmetrical chorioretinal atrophy, with accumulation of bone corpuscle pigmentation along the distribution of the retinal veins. PPCA is bilaterally symmetric, although unilateral cases have been reported. Most cases are sporadic and may represent an acquired response pattern to an infectious or inflammatory disease. There may be an autosomal dominant modes of inheritance caused by a mutation in the CRB1 gene or an X-linked inheritance mode.

DESCRIPTION Ascariasis is an commonly documented parasitic infection in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China and east Asia, affecting approximately 1.2 billion people. The adult worm are normaly found in the jejunum. Clinical disease increases with worm burden and those who harbour light infections tend to be asymptomatic. Heavy worm load may cause mechanical intestinal obstruction due to entangled adult worms.

DESCRIPTION Enterobiasis is one of the most widedspread parasitic nematode infections caused by Enterobius vermicularis that commonly referred as pinworm. About 209 million persons worldwide are affected. The adult worms live in the large intestine, from which the female migrates at night to lay eggs on the perineum, causing perineal, perianal, and vaginal irritation. Serious disease can rarely result, including urinary tract infection, and acute appendicitis.

DESCRIPTION The majority of human hookworm infections are caused by Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus. These worms attach to the intestinal mucosa and live for 1-5 years, sucking host blood. The major clinical features of chronic hookworm infection are iron-deficiency anemia and malnutrition, which are associated with varying degrees of cognitive and growth delay in children.

DESCRIPTION Paragonimiasis is a zoonotic disease caused by a parasite belonging to Paragonimus genus. Humans most commonly become infected through the ingestion of inadequately cooked freshwater crustaceans or products derived from these animals. In the world, it has been estimated that 293 million people are at risk and several million are actually infected. Most cases have been reported on the Asian continent. Paragonimiasis is essentially confined to lungs (pulmonary paragonimiasis). Its most remarkable clinical feature is a cough, and, less frequently, hemoptysis, distressing chest pain, and dyspnea.

NAME        Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, including:
            Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency;
            Pyruvate kinase hyperactivity
DESCRIPTION Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in PKLR that encodes both L-PK (expressed in liver, renal cortex, and small intestine) and R-PK (restricted to erythrocytes). The symptoms include jaundice, enlargement of the spleen, and hemolysis, leading to anemia. One hundred fifty-eight mutations associated with non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia and eight polymorphic sites have been so far reported in the PKLR gene. It has also been found that a specific mutation in the PKLR gene causes hereditary increase of red blood cell ATP.

DESCRIPTION Cerebral palsy is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental brain disorders resulting in motor and posture impairments often associated with cognitive, sensorial, and behavioural disturbances. It is thought that a half of idiopathic cerebral palsy cases are caused by genetic factors, such as mutations in GAD1, KANK1, and four subunits of the adaptor protein complex-4 (AP-4).

ENTRY       H01098                      Disease
NAME        Pentastomiasis
DESCRIPTION Pentastomiasis is an unusual parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stages of pentastomes (tongue worms). Its definitive hosts are reptiles whilst humans serve as rare intermediate hosts. In humans, the larva penetrates the gut wall and lodges in various internal organs. Infection is usually asymptomatic. In asymptomatic patients, no treatment is necessary.

ENTRY       H01100                      Disease
NAME        Strongyloidiasis
DESCRIPTION Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal parasite infection caused by soil-transmitted helminths of the genus Strongyloides. The disease infects 30 million people in 70 countries especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Strongyloides stercoralis has a complex life cycle. In humans, larvae reach the host's duodenum or jejunum and develop there into adult worms. Only females are found in the host where they are embedded in the duodenum and jejunum mucosa, producing eggs. These hatch, develop into infective larvae and penetrate the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin. Infection usually results in asymptomatic chronic disease of the gut, but in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, hyperinfection can occur with dissemination of larvae to multiple organs including the brain. The mortality rate of disseminated infections has been estimated to be as high as 87%.

DESCRIPTION Combined lipase deficiency (CLD) is characterized by very severe hypertriglyceridemia, recurrent acute pancreatitis, eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, and hepatosplenomegaly. CLD is caused by mutations in lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). LMF1 is a chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum and it is required for the post-translational activation of three vascular lipases, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase and endothelial lipase.

DESCRIPTION Pituitary adenomas are an important and frequently occurring form of intracranial tumour. They are usually benign but can give rise to severe clinical syndromes due to hormonal excess, or to visual/cranial disturbances due to mass effect. The tumour can be clinically nonfunctioning or hormone secreting. Among the latter, prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas are the most common. The majority of pituitary adenomas arise sporadically, although a subset occurs as component tumors of well-characterized familial cancer syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Carney complex, and MEN1-like syndrome (MEN4). It has been described non-MEN/CNC familial pituitary tumours that include all tumour phenotypes as a condition named familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA).

NAME        Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by low plasma levels of A1AT. The condition is associated with emphysematous lung disease and also with liver disease. A1AT is the archetype of the serine protease inhibitor. Mutations in the A1AT gene lead to misfolding of the protein and accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The accumulation of mutant A1AT protein has a directly toxic effect on the liver, resulting in hepatitis and cirrhosis. And the decrease in circulating A1AT results in protease-antiprotease imbalance at the lung surface and emphysema ensues.

NAME        Loiasis
DESCRIPTION Loiasis is an infection with Loa loa, a filarial parasite found in central Africa. The adult worms migrate freely through the subcutaneous tissues and sometimes can be observed moving through the sclera of the eye. Loiasis is often asymptomatic, but when a person has both onchocerciasis and loiasis, administration of ivermectin can cause serious neurological complications.

ENTRY       H01106                      Disease
NAME        Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) deficiency is a disorder resulting in increased fibrinolysis and an associated bleeding diathesis. PAI-1 is an important component of the coagulation system that down-regulates fibrinolysis in the circulation. Affected individuals exhibit mild to moderate bleeding symptoms, including epistaxis, menorrhagia, and delayed bleeding after trauma or surgical procedures. Spontaneous bleeding events are rarely seen in contrast to other procoagulant deficiencies. Generally most of the PAI-1-related diseases are due to elevated antigenic concentrations and their inhibitory activity. However, absence of cellular PAI-1 activity also causes several diseases. Clear documentation of PAI-1 deficiency as a cause of a bleeding disorder has been rare.

DESCRIPTION Human genetic platelet glycoprotein IV (CD36) deficiency may be related to the phenotypic expression of the metabolic syndrome and is frequently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. CD36 deficiency is relatively frequent in Asian and African populations. It also has been reported that CD36 deficiency might be linked with cardiomyopathy. This deficiency can be classified in two subgroups: the type I phenotype is characterized by platelets and monocytes/macrophages that exhibit CD36 deficiency; whereas in the type II phenotype, the surface expression of CD36 is lacking only in platelets, but expression is near normal in monocytes/macrophages.

DESCRIPTION Pneumothorax is defined as air or gas accumulated in the pleural space and can be classified as spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic pneumothorax includes iatrogenic cases caused during procedures such as pacemaker insertion. Spontaneous pneumothorax can be subclassified as primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), which is defined as a pneumothorax without underlying lung disease, predominantly occurs in young, thin males. It is usually caused by ruptured pleural blebs or bullae. Approximately 10% of patients with PSP have a positive family history. Gene mutations in folliculin (FLCN) have been found.

NAME        Cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD)
DESCRIPTION Cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD) is a rare abnormality of cortisone metabolism. There are close phenotypic similarities between CRD and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, anovulatory infertility, obesity, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. 11beta-HSD1 is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cortisone to cortisol within the endoplasmic reticulum. And loss of its activity results in CRD. Mutations in H6PD, which encodes an enzyme supplying cofactor for the reaction, also have been identified as the cause of CRD.

NAME        Ocular coloboma, including:
            Coloboma of iris choroid and retina (COI);
            Coloboma of optic nerve (COLON);
            Optic nerve hypoplasia
DESCRIPTION Ocular coloboma is a congenital and common malformation which includes a deficiency of the structures of the eye, such as the iris, retina, choroid, or optic disc. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs. Paired box gene 6 (PAX6), a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, has been identified as a key regulator of eye development. Currently around 500 mutations of PAX6 have been reported. And most PAX6 nonsense mutations lead to aniridia, while missense mutations are related to foveal hypoplasia, congenital cataracts, or anterior segment anomalies.

NAME        Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)
DESCRIPTION Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a mitochondrial disorder associated with mtDNA depletion and/or accumulation of mtDNA point mutations and deletions. PEO is characterized by late onset bilateral ptosis and progressive weakening of the external eye muscle, resulting in blepharoptosis and ophthalmoparesis, proximal muscle weakness, and wasting as well as exercise intolerance. Muscle biopsy results typically show ragged red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers. PEO is transmitted as dominant or recessive traits.

NAME        Prolidase deficiency (PD)
DESCRIPTION Prolidase deficiency (PD) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder due to the lack of prolidase (EC:3.4.13.9), a peptidase with a preference for Xaa-Pro dipeptide substrates that participates in collagen metabolism and in the terminal degradation of endogenous and dietary proteins. It typically begins in childhood and common symptoms include chronic intractable skin ulcerations and mental retardation. Mutations in prolidase gene causing the reduction or the loss of prolidase activity are responsible for PD.

NAME        Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)
DESCRIPTION Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterised by alveolar accumulation of surfactant composed of proteins and lipids due to defective surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. PAP is caused by a disruption in surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages due to loss of functional granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling. Three main categories of PAP have been defined depending on the aetiology: auto-immune, secondary, and genetic. Genetic PAP can result from mutations in CSF2RA, the gene encoding the alpha chain of the GM-CSF receptor and seen especially in children. Adult forms are mostly auto-immune (with GM-CSF antibodies) and/or secondary to toxic inhalation or hematological disorders, without anti-GM-CSF antibodies. Autoimmune PAP is the most common form (90%).

NAME        HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS) deficiency
DESCRIPTION HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS) deficiency is a autosomal recessive disorder of ketogenesis. Two isoforms of HMGCS are found in higher eukaryotes: the cytosolic HMGCS1 and mitochondrial HMGCS2. Mitochondrial HMGCS2 is involved in hepatic ketogenesis, and HMGCS2 deficiency causes hypoketotic hypoglycaemia after prolonged fasting. To date, no mutations have been identified in the human cytosolic HMGCS1.

NAME        Pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes intractable seizures that are not responsive to anticonvulsant drugs and pyridoxine. Patients with this deficiency have very low concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), leaving exogenous pyridoxal/PLP as the only source of the active cofactor. Clinically, this disease presents with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy with severe seizures which do not respond to anticonvulsant drugs or pyridoxine but shows a dramatic response to PLP. Pathogenic mutations in PNPO gene have been identified.

NAME        Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) is a recessively inherited form of hemolytic anemia characterized by peripheral blood morphology presenting with striking anisopoikilocytosis with red cell fragmentation and microspherocytes. Erythrocytes from most HPP patients exhibit qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin, the principal structural component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Qualitative spectrin defects are typically associated with missense mutations that lead to abnormal spectrin self-association, a process critical for membrane structure and function.

NAME        Reticular dysgenesis
DESCRIPTION Reticular dysgenesis (RD) is a rare congenital immunodeficiency classified within the severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs). It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and is characterized by absence of granulocytes and almost complete deficiency of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, hypoplasia of the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs, and lack of innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune functions, leading to fatal septicemia within days after birth. The bone marrow showed a maturation arrest in the myeloid and lymphoid lineage. The underlying genetic defect for most cases of RD have been identified in the gene encoding adenylate kinase 2 (AK2).

DESCRIPTION Late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD) is a rare autosomal dominant ocular disease characterized by onset in the fifth to sixth decade with night blindness and punctate yellow-white deposits between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, progressing to severe central and peripheral degeneration, with choroidal neovascularization and chorioretinal atrophy. L-ORD is caused by a mutation in the CTRP5 (C1QTNF5) gene, which encodes a short-chain collagen, changing a highly conserved serine to arginine (Ser163Arg). The mutation results in abnormal high molecular weight aggregate formation which may alter its higher-order structure and interactions.

NAME        Aplastic anemia (AA)
DESCRIPTION Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease in which the reduction of the circulating blood cells results from damage to the stem cell pool in bone marrow. Most cases of acquired aplastic anemia are the consequence of an immune-mediated destruction of hematopoiesis. Autoreactive cytotoxic T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of AA by myelosuppressive cytokines including interferon-gamma. It has been reported that polymorphisms in IFNG are related to AA. A minority of patients with AA has heterozygous mutations in genes encoding the telomerase components TERT or TERC. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is one of the main treatment modalities for AA, although most patients with telomerase mutations do not respond adequately to IST.

NAME        Reynolds syndrome
DESCRIPTION Reynolds syndrome is a rare disease associating primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and systemic scleroderma (SSc). It is typically classified as an autoimmune disorder since there are specific autoantibodies associated with both facets of the disease (antimitochondrial antibodies for PBC and anticentromere/antitopoisomerase for SSc), and suggestive microscopical abnormalities in the skin and liver. A mutation in the Lamin B receptor gene has been discovered in the white blood cells, suggesting that nuclear signalling defects could be a cause in Reynolds syndrome.

NAME        Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency is a very rare enzymopathy of the pentose phosphate pathway with one sole diagnosed case. The patient presented with progressive leukoencephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Systematic metabolic profiling identified elevated levels of arabitol and ribitol in affected brain regions and body fluids. RPI gene-sequence analysis revealed a frameshift and a missense mutation.

NAME        Carboxypeptidase N deficiency
DESCRIPTION Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is a plasma zinc metalloprotease that inactivates C3a, C4a, C5a, bradykinin, kalladin, and fibrinopeptides. CPN has been implicated as a major regulator of inflammation. Although deficiency of CPN produces a severe allergic syndrome, there are no reported cases of complete deficiency of CPN in humans. There are a few documented cases of partial CPN deficiency. Patients present some combination of angioedema or chronic urticaria, as well as hay fever or asthma. It has been reported that mutations in CPN1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of CPN, cause CPN deficiency.

NAME        Vitamin D-dependent rickets
DESCRIPTION Rickets is the failure of growing bone to mineralize. Many skeletal and radiographic changes can occur because of the lack of calcified osteoid and the buildup of unossified cartilage. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type I results from abnormalities in the gene coding for 25(OH)D3-1-alpha-hydroxylase and vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, and type II results from defective vitamin D receptors. Both diseases are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and early onset severe rickets.

ENTRY       H01153                      Disease
NAME        Human echinococcosis
DESCRIPTION Human echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by the larval stages of the cestode parasites Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis, affecting an estimated 2-3 million people worldwide. Contamination of humans occurs by the ingestion of the parasite eggs, either after touching carnivore hosts, or after eating food contaminated by carnivore feces. E. granulosus causes benign tumors/cysts (hydatid cyst disease) that is most often curable. Disease due to E. multilocularis (alveolar hydatid disease) is less common but more difficult to treat. In echinococcosis, anaphylactic reactions might occur with fatal outcome.

DESCRIPTION Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is the most common cause of ventricular pre-excitation, a condition where all or part of the ventricle is excited earlier than would normally be expected, often leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. It was recently discovered that mutations in PRKAG2, that encodes a subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase, is responsible for WPW syndrome.

DESCRIPTION Roussy-Levy syndrome (RLS) is a dominantly inherited early-onset syndrome consisting of gait ataxia, pes cavus, areflexia, eventually associated with muscle atrophy, postural tremors, limb ataxia, kyphoscoliosis, and sensory loss. The RLS subtype is not genetically homogeneous. RLS has been described as a phenotypic variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [DS:H00264] type 1A (CMT-1A) associated with duplications of the PMP22 gene. A mutations in the MPZ gene has been revealed indicating that the original RLS may fall under the CMT-1B subgroup of hereditary demyelinating neuropathies.

NAME        Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD), including:
            Anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis;
            Aniridia;
            Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS);
            Peters anomaly;
            Iridogoniodysgenesis (IRID)
DESCRIPTION Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) is a range of developmental defects in structures at the front of the eye. These defects are thought to result from abnormal migration or differentiation of the neural-crest derived mesenchymal cells that give rise to the cornea, iris, and other components of the anterior chamber during eye development. Human ASD phenotypes are genetically heterogeneous resulting from mutations in different transcription factor genes and a cytochrome enzyme gene.

NAME        Scott syndrome
DESCRIPTION Scott syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive congenital bleeding disorder caused by a defect in blood coagulation. When platelets are activated, a calcium-induced rearrangement of the platelet membrane phospholipids takes place, exposing negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) at the outer surface of the platelets, where it can anchor coagulation factors. This phenomenon is mediated by lipid scramblase. In patients with Scott syndrome this mechanism is defective, resulting in impaired blood clotting. A mutation in the gene encoding scramblase TMEM16F has been found.

NAME        Sea-blue histiocyte disease
DESCRIPTION Sea-blue histiocyte disease is a clinical entity characterized by splenomegaly, mild purpura secondary to thrombocytopenia, and most often with a relatively prolonged benign course. Numerous sea-blue histiocytes are observed in many organs including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. This disorder is classified as either primary or secondary; most cases are secondary to lipid metabolic diseases. A mutation in the APOE gene has been reported.

NAME        Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS)
DESCRIPTION Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a distinct form of hereditary early-onset spastic ataxia related to progressive degeneration of the cerebellum and spinal cord. ARSACS is clinically characterized by spasticity, ataxia, polyneuropathy, retinal changes, and in some cases late cognitive decline. Patients demonstrate an unsteady gait and experience frequent falls as they learn to walk. ARSACS is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, encoding a large protein sacsin. A recent study demonstrated that sacsin may interact with the Hsp70 chaperone machinery, which is an important component of the cellular response towards aggregation prone mutant proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

NAME        Infantile ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP)
DESCRIPTION Infantile-onset ascending spastic paralysis (IAHSP) is a rare autosomal recessive early onset motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the gene ALS2. IAHSP is allelic to juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS) [DS:H00058] and juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) [DS:H00970]. IAHSP can be distinguished from those two disorders by the association of an infantile onset, at the age of walking achievement, with an ascending progression during childhood but a long survival during adulthood.

NAME        Staphylococcal infection
DESCRIPTION Staphylococci are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. Firstly, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a most unusual coagulase-negative staphylococcus found on the human skin. It can cause infections at many sites including superficial skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and breast abscess. Endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Secondly, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, found among the normal skin flora, is commonly isolated from the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas of humans and causes septicemia, peritonitis, otitis, and urinary tract infections. S. haemolyticus is notorious for its multidrug resistance and historically early acquisition of resistance to methicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics. Finally, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an important opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. S. pseudintermedius colonization is very uncommon in humans. It is rarely isolated from human dog-bite wounds. The infection has been associated with wide range of symptoms such as bacteremia, a brain abscess, and pneumonia.

NAME        Uncomplicated urinary tract infection
DESCRIPTION Staphylococci are widespread as commensals of humans and animals where they colonize the skin or mucous membranes. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram-positive uropathogen and frequently isolated from young female outpatients presenting with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. S. saprophyticus causes uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) but no severe bacterial infectious disease as caused by S. aureus. The urease of S. saprophyticus is known to be a virulent factor for the persistent infection in the urinary tract. All of the virulence factors of S. aureus, such as coagulase, hemolysins, enterotoxins, extracellular matrixbinding proteins, and exoenzymes, are absent in the S. saprophyticus genome. Besides S. saprophyticus is a leading gram-positive uropathogen of uncomplicated UTI, a restricted group of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. is often observed to cause uncomplicated UTI.

NAME        Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN)
DESCRIPTION Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN) is a neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical degeneration of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and occasionally the globus pallidus, with little involvement of the rest of the brain. The clinical features of IBSN include developmental regression, choreoathetosis, dystonia, spasticity, dysphagia, failure to thrive, nystagmus, optic atrophy, and mental retardation. The mechanism of IBSN has not been elucidated, although it has been reported that IBSN usually occurs as a result of metabolic, familial, or toxic diseases. Mutations in the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene (complex V) have been described in families with mitochondrial inheritance, while there is much evidence that supports the role of the mutation in nup62 as the cause of autosomal recessive IBSN.

NAME        Myiasis
DESCRIPTION Myiasis is a parasitic infection of vital tissue of skin and mucous membranes by dipterous larvae. Human myiasis is a rare clinic condition but more prevalent in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Myiasis may be classified into three types: (i) primary myaisis in which the larva invades healthy tissue of the host, (ii) secondary myaisis where the adult female is attracted to and lays its eggs on wounded skin, and (iii) accidental myaisis caused by ingestion of contaminated food. Among many species of Diptera that cause larval infection in humans, Dermatobia hominis, the human botfly, is responsible for the painful, boil-like lesion of furuncular myiasis.

DESCRIPTION Tungiasis is a tropical ectoparasitosis caused by the penetration of small hematophagous flea (Tunga penetrans). It is prevalent where people live in extreme poverty, occurring in many Latin American countries. Contamination with adult females occurs when walking barefoot in the sand. After penetration, most commonly on the feet, the flea increases in volume, causing pruritus in hosts. After they eject the eggs, the lesion heals within a few days.

NAME        Sveinsson chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA);
            Helicoid peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration (HPCD)
DESCRIPTION Sveinsson chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA), also referred to as helicoid peripapillary chorioretinal degeneration (HPCD), is a distinct autosomal dominant disease affecting both eyes characterized clinically by bilateral, well defined, tongue-shaped strips of atrophic retina and choroid that extend from the optic nerve into the peripheral ocular fundus. The lesions may be evident at birth and usually progress throughout life, sometimes leading to central visual loss. Clinical findings suggest that the expansion of the degenerative lesions is caused by dysplastic abnormalities of the peripapillary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the mechanical tearing of the RPE layer owing to the growth of the globe. Patients with SCRA have a mutation in the TEAD1 gene.

NAME        T-cell immunodeficiency congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (TIDAND)
DESCRIPTION T-cell immunodeficiency congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (TIDAND) is a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) syndrome caused by a mutation in FOXN1 gene encoding the forkhead/winged helix (WHN) FOXN1 transcription factor selectively expressed in thymic epithelia and skin. SCIDs are disorders of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity, characterized by high susceptibility to develop severe and sometimes fatal infections. TIDAND is the only human SCID caused by an intrinsic abnormality of the epithelial component of the thymus. The disease is always associated with a profound T-cell defect.

DESCRIPTION Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the deposition of congophilic material in the vessels of the cortex and leptomeninges. Although CAA most commonly appears in a sporadic form associated with aging, several familial forms of CAA reported to date. Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is a rare, fatal amyloid disease in young people in Iceland caused by a mutation in cystatin C, which is an inhibitor of several cysteine proteinases. It has also been reported that mutations in APP are linked to CAA.

DESCRIPTION Abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism is a disorder associated with an inherited selenocysteine (Sec) incorporation defect, caused by mutations in SECISBP2 (also called SBP2). Because SBP2 is epistatic to selenoprotein synthesis, these defects have a generalized effect on selenoproteins. Fibroblasts of affected patients show decreased deiodinase type 2 (DIO2) enzymatic activity not linked to the DIO2 locus.

NAME        Tietz syndrome;
            Albinism-deafness syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant syndrome of hypopigmentation and deafness. A missense mutation has been found in the basic region of the MITF (microphthalmia associated transcription factor) gene. Mutations in other regions of this gene have been found to produce Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) [DS:H00169], which also includes pigmentary changes and hearing loss, but in contrast to Tietz syndrome, depigmentation is patchy and hearing loss is variable in WS2.

NAME        Tn syndrome
DESCRIPTION Tn syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the expression of the Tn antigen, an incompletely glycosylated membrane glycoprotein, on all blood cell lineages. The epitope of the Tn antigen is terminal alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine alpha-linked to either a serine or threonine amino-acid residue. The defect may be due to a malfunction of the glycosylating enzyme T-synthase. Tn syndrome is associated with a somatic mutation in Cosmc gene, encoding a molecular chaperone that is required for the proper folding and hence full activity of T-synthase.

NAME        Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency is an inborn error of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), presenting primarily with liver disease and variable clinical course. TALDO is one of the key enzymes the PPP. The severity of the symptoms can vary, ranging from fetal hydrops to slowly progressive liver cirrhosis, but patients show common symptoms like hydrops fetalis, dysmorphic features, liver dysfunction (cirrhosis), hemolytic anemia with renal involvement, and heart problems. The biochemical profile indicates an elevated level of erythritol, arabitol, ribitol, sedoheptitol, perseitol, sedoheptulose, mannoheptulose, and sedoheptulose-7P. The disorder is caused by mutations in the TALDO gene.

NAME        Transcobalamin II deficiency
DESCRIPTION Transcobalamin (TC) II deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) transport that leads to intracellular Cbl depletion with secondary impairment of methionine synthetase and methyl-malonyl CoA mutase activities. This disorder presents with failure to thrive, mucosal ulceration, vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, irritability, and occasionally immunological dysfunction. Affected individuals may suffer from long-term neurological sequelae if therapy with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin is not initiated promptly. Mutations in the TCN2 gene are known to cause.

DESCRIPTION Asthma is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with many etiologic factors and clinical characteristics. In some patients with asthma, aspirin and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) trigger asthmatic attacks. This clinical syndrome is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of nasal and bronchial tissue, often associated with nasal polyps. It has been reported that genetic variations in TBX21 are associated with susceptibility to asthma with nasal polyps and aspirin intolerance.

DESCRIPTION Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) deficiency is a connective tissue disorder, caused by defects in PLOD3 that encodes LH3. This disease is characterized by congenital malformations severely affecting many tissues and organs and revealing features of several collagen disorders. In addition to lysyl hydroxylase activity, LH3 has also collagen galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase activities. It has been reported that one mutation dramatically reduced the sugar-transfer activity of LH3.

NAME        Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC)
DESCRIPTION Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) refers to a group of disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, distinguished by the development of ectopic and vascular calcified masses that occur in settings of hyperphosphatemia (hFTC) and normophosphatemia (nFTC). hFTC is characterized by increased re-absorption of phosphate through the renal proximal tubule, resulting in elevated phosphate concentration and deposition of calcified deposits in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, occasionally, in visceral organs. hFTC has been shown to result from mutations in three genes: fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), KL encoding Klotho, and GALNT3, which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for FGF23 O-glycosylation; defective function of any one of these three proteins results in hyperphosphatemia and ectopic calcification. nFTC is characterized by absence of metabolic abnormalities. nFTC has been found to be associated with absence of functional SAMD9, a putative tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory protein.

NAME        X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata, including:
            X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX1);
            X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2)
DESCRIPTION Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a congenital disorder characterized by a skeletal abnormality, characterized by punctate calcification of the cartilage of the epiphyses, larynx and trachea. Different forms of CDP exist, the most common of which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (Rhizomelic CDP). CDP may also be inherited in a recessive and dominant X-linked fashion. The X-linked recessive CDP (CDPX1) characterized by facial anomalies with severe nasal hypoplasia, short stature, and distal phalangeal hypoplasia. Mutations in ARSE which encodes arylsulfatase E, showing a high sequence homology to steroid sulfatase. In X-linked dominant CDP (CDPX2), aberrant punctate calcification in cartilage is most prominent around the vertebral column, pelvis, and long bones. Additionally, CDPX2 patients may have asymmetric rhizomesomelia, sectorial cataracts, patchy alopecia, ichthyosis, and atrophoderma. It has been found that defects in D8-D7 sterol isomerase (EBP) cause CDPX2 and suggest a role for sterols in bone development.

NAME        VACTERL/VATER association
DESCRIPTION The acronym VATER/VACTERL association refers to the rare, non-random co-occurrence of vertebral defects (V), anorectal malformations (A), cardiac defects (C), tracheo-esophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia (TE), renal malformations (R), and limb defects (L). It is typically defined by the presence of at least three of these cardinal features. The aetiology has been identified only in a small fraction of patients to date, likely due to factors such as a high degree of clinical and causal heterogeneity, the largely sporadic nature of the disorder, and the presence of many similar conditions. Chromosomal abnormalities have been described in rare individual cases and proposed as possible causal factors, including: deletions of distal 13q, ring chromosome 12, and 6q; duplication on 9q;  mutations in PTEN, HOXD13, and ZIC3; and a mitochondrial substitution.

ENTRY       H01196                      Disease
NAME        Hypochromic microcytic anemia
DESCRIPTION Hypochromic microcytic anemia has been associated with a defect of iron absorption due to reduced iron entry into intestinal cells. Several isoforms of NRAMP2 (SLC11A2) are expressed ubiquitously in recycling endosomes or specifically at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in intestine and kidneys, and can contribute to iron overload, whereas mutations impairing NRAMP2 function cause a form of congenital hypochromic microcytic anemia.

NAME        Fanconi renotubular syndrome (FTS)
DESCRIPTION Fanconi renotubular syndrome (FTS) is a disease resulting from a generalized dysfunction of the proximal kidney tubule leading to decreased solute and water reabsorption. Patients had a generalized proximal tubulopathy, renal phosphate wasting, bone mineral deficiency, and decreased glomerular filtration rates. It is reported that mutations in SLC34A1, which encodes the renal sodium-inorganic phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIa, may cause this disease.

ENTRY       H01199                      Disease
NAME        Hyperalphalipoproteinemia
DESCRIPTION Hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP) is a condition of elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. The most important cause of primary HALP is a genetic deficiency of CETP, which has been reported mainly from Japan. A mutation in APOC3 gene is also associated in some families. Familial HALP often coexists with longevity, and that higher HDL-C levels are found among healthy elderly. HALP is also associated with some diseases. Recent studies have shown that hetero and homozygosity for CETP gene mutations is associated with an increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.

NAME        Cataract
DESCRIPTION Cataracts can be defined as any opacity of the crystalline lens, often associated with breakdown of the lens microarchitecture, possibly including vacuole formation and disarray of lens cells, which can cause large fluctuations in density resulting in light scattering. In addition, light scattering and opacity will occur if there is a significant amount of high molecular weight protein aggregates. Cataracts can be classified by the age at onset: a congenital or infantile cataract presents within the first year of life; a juvenile cataract presents within the first decade of life; a presenile cataract presents before the age of about 45 years, and senile or age-related cataract after that. Congenital cataracts are a major cause of induced blindness in children, and inherited cataracts are the major cause of congenital cataracts. Inherited congenital cataracts have been associated with mutations in specific genes, including those of crystallins, gap junction proteins, membrane transport and channel proteins, the cytoskeleton, and growth and transcription factors. Inherited congenital cataracts may be inherited as autosomal dominant (most frequent), autosomal recessive, or X-linked traits.

DESCRIPTION Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a severe form of glaucoma that presents early in life. PCG results from developmental abnormalities that affect the aqueous humor outflow pathway. PCG clinical features include elevated IOP, corneal edema, enlargement of the globe (buphthalmos), corneal enlargement, rupture of Descemet's membrane, and optic nerve damage. Two genes have been reported to cause PCG, CYP1B1 and LTBP2. Both genes cause a recessive form of this disease.

NAME        Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ)
DESCRIPTION Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation (MR), and dysequilibrium syndrome (CAMRQ) is autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous conditions characterized by early onset of cerebellar ataxia and MR. Patients with CAMRQs have a severe disturbance of posture and balance, strabismus, muscular hypotonia during childhood and they have a delayed ability to walk independently. The disease is also characterized by perceptual difficulties and in most cases mild mental retardation. Three subtypes have been mapped so far. CAMRQ1 and CAMRQ3 are caused by mutations in the VLDLR and CA8 genes, respectively, while the gene for CAMRQ2 remains to be cloned.

NAME        Coumarin resistance;
            Warfarin resistance
DESCRIPTION Warfarin is widely prescribed anticoagulant for the prevention of thromboembolic diseases. However, its use is made difficult by the wide interindividual variation in dose required to achieve a therapeutic effect, the narrow therapeutic range, and the risk of serious bleeding. Warfarin dose requirement is influenced by factors such as intake of vitamin K, ethnicity, age, gender, and genetic factors. Warfarin acts through interference with the recycling of vitamin K in the liver. It has been reported that mutations in VKORC1, CYP2C9, and GGCX cause warfarin resistance.

DESCRIPTION Plasminogen deficiency is characterized by decreased serum plasminogen activity. Two forms of the disorder are distinguished. Type 1, also called hypoplasminogenemia, is associated with pseudomembrane disease. Ligneous conjunctivitis is the most common of the clinical syndromes associated with plasminogen deficiency, although numerous other organs have been reported to be affected. Type 2, also known as dysplasminogenemia, is characterized by normal, or slightly reduced antigen levels, and absence of clinical manifestations.

            Round-headed spermatozoa
DESCRIPTION Globozoospermia is a rare form of teratozoospermia, mainly characterized by round-headed spermatozoa that lack an acrosome. Acrosome plays an important role at the site of sperm-zonapellucida binding during the fertilization process. It was suggested that a homozygous mutation in SPATA16 was associated with male infertility in human globozoospermia. It has also been reported that a recurrent deletion of DPY19L2 causes infertility in man by blocking sperm head elongation and acrosome formation.

NAME        Deafness, X-linked
DESCRIPTION Hereditary deafness is divided into syndromic forms (in which hearing loss is associated with a variety of other anomalies) and non-syndromic forms. Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal-dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. X-linked deafness is clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. PRPS1 and POU3F4 have been identified as the genes to be implicated in X-linked non-syndromic hearing loss.

ENTRY       H01213                      Disease
NAME        Gallbladder disease;
            Cholecystitis;
            Cholelithiasis
DESCRIPTION Gallbladder disease is one of the most common digestive disorders. Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder wall, that is almost always associated with cholelithiasis, or gallstones. Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis appear to be caused by the actions of several genes and environment working together. It has been reported that an ABCB4 mutation which causes a deficiency in biliary phosphatidylcholine secretion is associated with gallstones. Recently, several common DNA polymorphisms in the ABCG8 gene were discovered that are associated with gallstone disease.

            Rh-deficiency syndrome
DESCRIPTION Rh (Rhesus) null hemolytic anemia (RHN) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an absence of Rh antigens and a varying degree of hemolytic anemia and spherostomatocytosis. The Rh protein family comprises Rh50 glycoprotein and Rh30 polypeptides, which form a complex essential for Rh antigen expression and erythrocyte membrane integrity. It is reported that RHN is caused by mutations of RHAG that encodes Rh50 glycoprotein.

DESCRIPTION Simpson Golabi Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is a complex congenital overgrowth syndrome with features that include macroglossia, macrosomia, and renal and skeletal abnormalities as well as an increased risk of embryonal cancers. Most cases of SGBS is type 1, that appear to arise as a result of either deletions or point mutations within the glypican-3 (GPC3) gene. SGBS type 2 is a severe variant, that is associated with defects in OFD1.

DESCRIPTION Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare and potentially progressive cardiomyopathy, characterized by the presence of prominent trabeculations of the left ventricle, associated with progressive systolic failure, stroke and arrhythmia. It has been linked to mutations in several genes, including LIM domain binding protein 3 (ZASP), alpha-dystrobrevin (DTNA), tafazzin (TAZ/G4.5), lamin A/C (LMNA), and genes encoding the sarcomeric proteins, beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), alpha-cardiac actin (ACTC), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2).

NAME        Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA)
DESCRIPTION Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is a chronic itchy skin disorder associated with amyloid deposits in the superficial dermis. It is a purely cutaneous disease with no association with systemic forms of amyloidosis. Clinically, skin lesions comprise small, flat-top papules (lichen amyloidosis) or brown-gray macules (macular amyloidosis). PLCA is relatively common in South America and Asia, and some cases have an autosomal dominant family history (familial PLCA, FPLCA). The genetic basis of FPLCA involves mutations in the OSMR and IL31RA genes. Both belong to the family of interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokine receptors.

NAME        P14 deficiency
DESCRIPTION The deficiency of the late endosomal-lysosomal MEK binding partner 1 (MP1)-interacting protein (also known as p14 and MAPBPIP) causes a primary immunodeficiency syndrome comprising congenital neutropenia, partial albinism, short stature and B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell deficiency. This protein is an adaptor molecule orchestrating the subcellular anatomy of MAP kinase signaling, and is crucial for the function of neutrophils, B cells, cytotoxic T cells and melanocytes.

DESCRIPTION Epithelial basement membrane corneal dystrophy (EBMD) is a common bilateral epithelial dystrophy. There is usually no hereditary pattern, but some cases presented with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the TGFBI/BIGH3 genes, which are known to cause various forms of corneal dystrophies, have been identified. Sheet-like areas of basement membrane originating from the basal epithelial cells of the corneal epithelium and extending superficially into the epithelium are the hallmarks of EBMD. Most patients are asymptomatic before the age of 30 years, but 10% of them may have recurrent idiopathic erosions and a loss of vision due to surface irregularity.

DESCRIPTION Cowden syndrome (CS) is a autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome characterized by benign and malignant breast, thyroid, and endometrial neoplasias in addition to cutaneous findings and macrocephaly. Germ line PTEN mutations have been found in 85% of those with CS. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time. In the absence of germline PTEN mutations, approximately 10% of individuals with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome harbor germline succinate dehydrogenase variants SDHB and SDHD.

NAME        Mental retardation-stereotypic movements-epilepsy and/or cerebral malformations (MRSME);
            Chromosome 5q14.3 deletion syndrome
DESCRIPTION Mental retardation-stereotypic movements-epilepsy and/or cerebral malformations (MRSME) is a disorder characterized by severe mental retardation, absent speech, hypotonia, poor eye contact and stereotypic movements. Most of the patients presented also with facial dysmorphic features, epilepsy and cerebral malformations. It has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of MEF2C is responsible for MRSME.

NAME        Ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus (KPD)
DESCRIPTION Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is a widespread, emerging, heterogeneous syndrome, mostly observed in subjects of west African origin (west Africans and African-Americans), characterized by patients who present with diabetic ketoacidosis or unprovoked ketosis but do not necessarily have the typical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Multiple, severe forms of beta-cell dysfunction appear to underlie the pathophysiology of KPD. KPD can be classified into four A beta groups, based on the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65, GAD67, or IA-2 autoantibodies (A+ or A-) and beta-cell functional reserve (beta+ or beta-). Homozygous carriers of the PAX4 R133W variant have an increased risk of KPD.

DESCRIPTION D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder. Clinical symptoms of D-2-HGA are developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. It has been suggested that mutations in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene cause D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Recently, IDH2 mutations in patients with D-2-HGA were reported.

DESCRIPTION GLI3 morphopathies are autosomal dominant developmental defect syndromes, including Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, preaxial polydactyly type-IV, and postaxial polydactyly. All GLI3 morphopathies show malformations of the autopod, such as polydactylies or syndactylies. Heterozygous mutations in human GLI3, a zinc-finger transcription factor, are associated with these syndromes. GLI3 is regarded as a mediator of sonic hedgehog signaling regulating development at multiple sites such as the limbs, the lungs, and the brain.

DESCRIPTION Inflammatory bowel disease is a heterogeneous group of chronic disorders, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients suffer chronically from abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding, and malabsorption. In most patients, these disorders are manifested in adolescence or adulthood, however, they may present in infancy and may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It has been reported that mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine.

DESCRIPTION Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans (IRAN) is an unusual cause of diabetes that result from metabolic abnormalities associated with mutations of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene, characterized by phenotypic description of extreme insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism. Other phenotype of IRAN form includes hirsutism and polycystic ovarian disease in a patient who is usually not obese. There is no distinctive serum marker. Leprechaunism [DS:H00719] and the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome [DS:H00942] also have mutations in INSR with subsequent alterations in insulin receptor function and extreme insulin resistance.

NAME        Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM3)
DESCRIPTION Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM3) is an autosomal dominant myopathy associated with a heterozygous missense mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa gene (MYH2), changing the highly conserved and negatively charged glutamate at position 706 to the positively charged lysine (E706K). This region is important for myosin functioning during muscle contraction, because it undergoes conformational changes during adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Clinical characteristics include congenital joint contractures, a progressive course in adulthood, and external ophthalmoplegia.

DESCRIPTION Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical widespread myelin loss in the central nervous system. Although a phenotype is similar to that of multiple sclerosis, ADLD neuropathology shows preservation of oligodendroglia in the presence of subtotal demyelination and lack of astrogliosis.  It has been reported that ADLD can be caused by a tandem genomic duplication resulting in an extra copy of the lamin B1 gene.

NAME        Trimethylaminuria (TMAU);
            Fish-odor syndrome
DESCRIPTION Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odour syndrome, is a metabolic disorder. TMAU usually presents with a body odour resembling that of rotten or decaying fish, the result of excess excretion of trimethylamine (TMA) in the breath, sweat, urine, and reproductive fluids. Primary TMAU is most often caused by a functional defect of flavin mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3), and the genetic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner as a consequence of mutations in the FMO3 gene. Secondary TMAU has been described in patients with severe liver disease (which is the major site of activity of the FMO3 enzyme) and chronic renal disease (as a consequence of bacterial overgrowth in the gut), and in patients treated with large doses of betaine or possibly L-carnitine. In addition, transient TMAU has been reported in a preterm infant who was fed with choline-rich food supplements and has been reported in some women just at the onset of menstruation.

NAME        Familial articular chondrocalcinosis
DESCRIPTION Chondrocalcinosis is a common cause of joint pain and arthritis caused by calcium deposition in articular cartilage and the presence of calcium hypophosphate crystals in synovial fluid, cartilage and periarticular soft tissue. Although most cases are sporadic, rare familial forms have been linked to human chromosomes 8 (CCAL1) or 5p (CCAL2). It has been suggested that mutations in the ANKH gene, which is located on the chromosome 5p, are one cause of chondrocalcinosis.

ENTRY       H01237                      Disease
NAME        Sulfite oxidase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare inherited disease with severe neurological symptoms such as intractable neonatal or infantile seizures, hypotonia or hypertonia, feeding difficulties, profound developmental delay, and dislocated lens. Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency results from defects in the enzyme sulfite oxidase, which is responsible for the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Several mutations have been identified from patients suffering from isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. The more common molybdenum cofactor deficiency [DS:H00192] leads to combined defects in xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase, as sulfite oxidase is 1 of 3 enzymes in humans that requires molybdenum as a cofactor, the other 2 being xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. The seizures in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency may even begin prenatally, and are much more severe compared with those in molybdenum cofactor deficiency.

NAME        Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP);
            Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura
DESCRIPTION Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder, and the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options. It has been reported that the activating FCGR2C-ORF genotype predisposes to ITP by altering the balance of activating and inhibitory Fc[gamma]R on immune cells.

NAME        Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)
DESCRIPTION Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is defined as a protrusion of abdominal viscera into the thorax through an abnormal opening or defect that is present at birth. CDH is often associated with potentially lethal lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Despite advances in therapy, mortality remains high. Although the etiology of most cases of CDH remains unknown, there is increasing evidence that specific pathways and genes play a role in the development of CDH. It has been reported that a patient who has nonsense mutation in FOG2/ ZFPM2, died at birth with a diaphragmatic defect and severe pulmonary hypoplasia.

ENTRY       H01242                      Disease
NAME        Saccharopinuria
DESCRIPTION Saccharopinuria is a metabolic disorder caused by a defect in a bifunctional protein with lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) activity and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which catalyzes the first two steps in the lysine-degradation pathway. Patients with this disorder have both hyperlysinemia and saccharopinuria, although the saccharopinuria is much more severe. It seems likely that this disorder results from specific mutations in the portion of AASS encoding SDH, which could explain the high levels of saccharopine, compared with that in patients with hyperlysinemia [DS:H00188].

NAME        Huntington's disease-like syndrome
DESCRIPTION Huntington's disease (HD), which is caused by a triplet-repeat expansion in the IT15 gene (also known as huntingtin or HD), accounts for about 90% of cases of chorea of genetic etiology. In recent years, several other distinct genetic disorders have been identified that can present with a clinical picture indistinguishable from HD, termed HD-like (HDL) syndromes. So far, four genes associated with HDL syndromes have been identified, including the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2) and, the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (HDL4).

NAME        Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE)
DESCRIPTION Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is an autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a therapeutic response to pharmacological dosages of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) and resistance to conventional antiepileptic treatment. Antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency is the main cause of PDE. Antiquitin is encoded by ALDH7A1 gene, and functions in the lysine degradation pathway. Its deficiency results in accumulation of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA), piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C) and pipecolic acid, which serve as diagnostic markers in urine, plasma, and CSF.

NAME        Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by impaired intestinal folate absorption. HFM is characterized by anemia, hypoimmunoglobulinemia, and recurrent infections. When diagnosed early, the signs and symptoms can be obviated by high oral doses of folates. Recently, several mutations were identified in the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) gene from patients with HFM.

NAME        Isolated follicle-stimulating hormone deficiency (IFSHD)
DESCRIPTION Isolated follicle-stimulating hormone deficiency (IFSHD) can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the beta chain of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  FSH is essential for normal puberty and fertility in females, particularly ovarian follicular development beyond the antral stage. In males, FSH is necessary for normal spermatogenesis and when FSH function is completely absent, infertility occurs. With partial FSH deficiency in males, spermatogenesis is affected, but fertility may still be possible.

DESCRIPTION Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD) is a cardiac bundle branch disorder characterized by progressive alteration of cardiac conduction through the His-Purkinje system. It leads to complete atrioventricular block causing syncope and sudden death. Mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel are responsible for Brugada syndrome (BS) and also for PCCD. Furthermore, another PCCD is caused by mutations in TRPM4.

NAME        Hydrolethalus syndrome
DESCRIPTION Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) is an autosomal recessive lethal malformation syndrome leading to stillbirth or death shortly after birth. HLS is characterized by hydrocephaly with absent upper midline structures of the brain, micrognathia and polydactyly. HLS is caused by mutations in HYLS1 and KIF7. Both genes code for ciliary or centriolar proteins that seem to be involved in early embryonic development of the midline.

ENTRY       H01267                      Disease
NAME        Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF)
DESCRIPTION Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease have disclosed specific genetic defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC. Diazoxide is often ineffective in mutations of the ATP- dependent potassium channel and may not adequately control hypoglycemia in GCK or SLC16A1 mutations.

NAME        Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome;
            HHH syndrome
DESCRIPTION Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by mental retardation, progressive spastic paraparesis, seizures, and myoclonus epilepsy. This disease varies widely in its severity and age of onset. The HHH syndrome is thought to be caused by the defective activities of the mitochondrial carrier responsible for transporting ornithine from the cytoplasm into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, that encodes the mitochondrial ornithine transporter have been shown to be correlated with the HHH syndrome.

DESCRIPTION Congenital hyperthyroidism is a rare clinical condition, and in most cases, it is a transient disorder caused by maternal Graves disease associated with the transplacental passage of maternal thyroid-stimulating antibodies. Germline mutations of thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene determining a constitutive activation of the receptor were identified as a molecular cause of congenital nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism. TSHR gene mutations also causes the familial gestational hyperthyroidism, that is characterized by thyrotoxicosis and hyperemesis gravidarum.

            Hereditary intrinsic factor deficiency (IFD);
            Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (IGS)/ Megaloblastic anemia 1
DESCRIPTION Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is caused by intestinal malabsorption of cobalamin. Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (IGS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by juvenile megaloblastic anaemia and neurological symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, cognitive problems, and dementia. If untreated, the disease is fatal. Biallelic mutations either in the cubilin (CUBN) or amnionless (AMN) gene cause IGS. Both proteins are involved in intestinal absorption and renal tubular reabsorption. Hereditary intrinsic factor deficiency (IFD) is a phenotype that is caused by mutations in GIF, the gene encoding intrinsic factor.

DESCRIPTION Spermatogenic failure is reflected in a lower or absent production of spermatozoa and is described by routine semen analysis using terms such as azoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia or asthenozoospermia. The genetic causes of spermatogenetic failure still remain largely unknown. It has been estimated that more than 2300 genes play a role in spermatogenesis. But only a few of these genes have been investigated in humans.

NAME        Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by developmental delay, seizure, hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy and malonic aciduria. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of fatty acids synthesis and is important in muscle and brain metabolism. Mutations in MLYCD gene that encodes MCD, result in a deficiency of MCD activity.

NAME        Congenital mirror movements (CMM)
DESCRIPTION Mirror movements are involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements on the opposite side. While mirror movements are occasionally found in young children, persistence beyond the age of 10 is abnormal. Congenital mirror movements (CMM) is a rare disorder that is mainly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Mutations in DCC, the gene encoding receptor for netrin 1 have been identified in CMM patients. It has also been reported that RAD51 haploinsufficiency causes the heterogeneous CMM.

NAME        Narcolepsy
DESCRIPTION Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by irresistible excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, a condition triggered by strong emotions leading to a sudden loss of muscle tone. Narcolepsy is a rare and mainly sporadic disorder. Familial narcolepsy accounts for less than 10% of all narcolepsy cases, and causative mutations have not been identified to date. The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack. It has also been reported that a missense mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is the cause of narcolepsy.

NAME        Neurodegeneration due to cerebral folate transport deficiency
DESCRIPTION Neurodegeneration due to cerebral folate transport deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of brain specific folate deficiency, characterized by severe developmental regression, movement disturbances, epilepsy, and leukodystrophy. Folate-receptor alpha (FOLR1) is of central importance for folate transport across the blood brain barrier via the choroid plexus. It has been reported that mutations in FOLR1 cause this disease. Folinic acid therapy can reverse the clinical symptoms and improve brain abnormalities and function.

NAME        Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
DESCRIPTION Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is a rare autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by compressive focal neuropathies and an underlying sensorimotor demyelinative polyneuropathy. HNPP is caused by a peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) gene deletion. PMP22 is duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). The other identified underlying genetic defects in HNPP are point mutations in PMP22 that lead to premature or delayed translation.

NAME        Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH);
            Pulmonary venoocclusive disease
DESCRIPTION Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a progressive vascular disorder that is often fatal as a result of right heart failure. Mutations in BMPR2, encoding a bone morphogenetic type II receptor of the TGF-beta family, are the major genetic determinant in PPH. Mutations in BMPR2 also cause Pulmonary venoocclusive disease, a rare form of pulmonary hypertension in which the vascular changes originate in the small pulmonary veins and venules. Recently, it has been indicated that mutations in the SMAD family represent infrequent causes of PPH.

NAME        FRA12A mental retardation
DESCRIPTION FRA12A mental retardation is a rare form of mental retardation caused by expansion of CGG repeat. This repeat is in the 5' untranslated region of the gene DIP2B. It has been suggested that deficiency of DIP2B, a brain-expressed gene, may mediate the neurocognitive problems associated with FRA12A.

NAME        Nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder (NDNC)
DESCRIPTION Nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder is rare and has been reported in only a small number of families. There is variable expression of nail phenotypes among individuals. It have identified that mutations in the RSPO4 and FZD6, components of the Wnt pathway, cause the hypoplastic nail disorders. Hereditary leukonychia is caused by mutations in PLCD1. Defects in COL7A1 can cause heterogeneous clinical phenotypes extending from simple toe nail dystrophy without skin fragility to typical dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.

NAME        Sarcoidosis, early-onset
DESCRIPTION Early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) is a special subtype of sarcoidosis, a systematic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. It occurs in children younger than 4 years of age and is characterized by a distinct triad of skin, joint, and eye disorders without apparent pulmonary involvement. Mutations in the gene encoding NOD2 in humans have been associated with EOS. NOD2 is an intracellular microbial sensor of the innate immune system that can act as a potent activator and regulator of inflammation.

NAME        Multi-minicore disease (MmD);
            Multicore myopathy with external ophthalmoplegia
DESCRIPTION Multi-minicore Disease (MmD) is a recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by multiple cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. It is morphologically defined by localized multiple areas of mitochondrial depletion and sarcomere disorganization, running to a limited extent along the longitudinal axis of muscle fiber ("minicores"). Marked clinical variability corresponds to genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in the SEPN1 gene have been identified in patients with the classic axial phenotype characterized by spinal rigidity, early scoliosis, and respiratory impairment, whereas mutations in the RYR1 gene have been associated with a wider range of clinical features comprising external ophthalmoplegia, distal weakness and wasting or predominant hip girdle involvement.

NAME        Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) infection
DESCRIPTION Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) infection is common in developing countries and comparatively rare in developed countries. EIEC invades intestinal epithelial cells, causing necrosis, ulceration of the mucous membrane, resulting in a dysentery-like syndrome with fever and mucous-bloody stools. EIEC strains contain a large invasion-associated plasmid, which are nearly identical to those of Shigella species.

DESCRIPTION Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC, also known as EAggEC) infection is a cause of traveler's diarrhea and persistent watery diarrhea in young children and patients infected with HIV. EAEC adheres to the small intestine via aggregative adherence fimbriae. The adherent rods resemble stacked bricks and result in shortening of microvilli. Approximately 40% of EAEC strains produce a heat-stable toxin, EAST1.

NAME        Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)
DESCRIPTION Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious and severe form of eye disease caused by human adenoviruses (HAdVs). There are two well-defined adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis clinical syndromes: EKC and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) [DS:H01420], which are caused by different HAdV serotypes. HAdV-8, HAdV-19, and HAdV-37 are common causative agents of EKC. In addition to these above-mentioned types, HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-9, HAdV-15, HAdV-53, and HAdV-54 have also been identified as causative agents of EKC. However, HAV-8 is responsible for the highest number of EKC cases worldwide and is associated with severe clinical manifestations. EKC patients may complain about influenza-like symptoms, including fever, malaise, respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. The incubation period is 2-14 days, and the person may remain infectious for 10-14 days after the onset of the symptoms. Symptoms tend to last for 7-21 days.

NAME        Pneumococcal disease, including:
            Invasive pneumoniae disease;
            Non-invasive pneumoniae disease;
            Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae
DESCRIPTION Pneumococcal disease (PD) is infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). PD is particularly common in younger children and in older adults and is roughly divided into invasive and non-invasive disease; the former refers to infections in which the microorganism is isolated from normal sterile body sites, such as the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid. Non-invasive PD can principally be divided into sinusitis, acute otitis media, and community-acquired pneumonia. S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The invasive PD burden is mainly determined by pneumococcal meningitis, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal bacteremia without a primary focus. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by PD.

DESCRIPTION Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF), which is caused by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (H. aegyptius), is a recently described pediatric disease that is often fatal. The vascular destruction is a distinctive trait, and little is known about the mechanism(s) of the overwhelming purpura fulminans that causes the high mortality. This disease is preceded by purulent conjunctivitis which resolves but is followed 10-14 days later by acute onset of fever associated with systemic toxicity, petechiae, purpura, and vascular collapse.

NAME        Dental caries
DESCRIPTION Dental caries occurs due to demineralization of enamel and dentine (the hard tissues of the teeth) by organic acids formed by bacteria in dental plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of sugars derived from the diet. The 2 primary bacteria involved in caries formation are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. When sugars or other fermentable carbohydrates are ingested, the resulting fall in dental plaque pH caused by organic acids increases the solubility of calcium hydroxyapatite in the dental hard tissues and demineralization occurs as calcium is lost from the tooth surface. The pH at which demineralization occurs is often referred to as the critical pH and is approximately 5.5.

NAME        Helicobacter heilmannii infection
DESCRIPTION Helicobacter heilmannii (H. heilmannii) infection is a relatively rare causative agent of gastroduodenal diseases in children. H. heilmannii frequently colonizes gastric mucosa of animals, mainly cats and dogs, from where it can be transmitted to humans. Generally, H. heilmannii infection is associated with mild gastritis. However, association with duodenal ulcer, acute gastric mucosal lesion, and gastric carcinoma have been observed. In addition, a close association with low-grade primary gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has been described both in humans and in experimental animals.

DESCRIPTION It has been reported that those patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are probably more common in those individuals with metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Of those with NASH, approximately 20% will go on to develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

            Pityriasis versicolor
DESCRIPTION Tinea versicolor, also known as pityriasis versicolor, dermatomycosis furfuracea and tinea flava, is caused by Malassezia species which are naturally found on the skin surfaces of many animals, including humans.
            Patients with tinea versicolor most commonly have multiple macules or patches on the trunk, with skip regions of normal skin in between.
            In addition, it is estimated that these species cause most skin disease in humans, including the most common cause of atopic dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis.

NAME        Photorhabdus asymbiotica infection
DESCRIPTION Photorhabdus asymbiotica, a gram-negative bacterium is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes locally invasive soft tissue and disseminated bacteremic infections in the United States and Australia. Australian isolates of P. asymbiotica formed mutualistic association with Heterorhabditis indica, a nematode species but although unproven for P. asymbiotica in North America. Whether this nematode is able to penetrate intact human skin is unclear, although direct skin penetration by nematodes is well recognized (e.g. hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis).

NAME        Encephalitozoon infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Encephalitozoon are spore-forming obligate intracellular microsporidian parasites that infect a wide range of organisms, including protists, invertebrates, humans, and many other vertebrates and known as opportunistic pathogen associated with immunocompromised individuals. Major symptoms include a life-threatening chronic diarrhea and systemic disease. The transmission routes may involve person-to-person as well as waterborne or foodborne, especially in developing countries with poor sanitation. E. intestinalis is recognized as one of the most frequently identified microsporidia in humans, and is associated with diarrhea, malabsorption, cholangitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, nephritis and intestinal perforation.

NAME        Asymptomatic bacteriuria
DESCRIPTION The term asymptomatic bacteriuria is generally used to distinguish colonization from infection and to emphasize that the presence of bacteria at mucosal surfaces does not always cause symptoms and tissue damage. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been attracting attention as a model to study mechanisms underlying the development of commensalism. Escherichia coli strain 83972 was isolated from the urine of a Swedish patient who was colonized for at least 3 years without displaying clinical signs of a urinary tract infection.

            Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) [DS:H00590];
            Bethlem myopathy [DS:H01340];
            Myosclerosis [DS:H01338]
DESCRIPTION Collagen VI-related myopathy include severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and milder Bethlem myopathy. Mutations in each of the three collagen VI genes COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 cause these diseases. Recently, an additional phenotypes, autosomal recessive myosclerosis with mutations in COL6A2 have been reported. Collagen VI is an important component of the extracellular matrix which forms a microfibrillar network that is found in close association with the cell and surrounding basement membrane. Thus, collagen VI mutations result in disorders with combined muscle and connective tissue involvement, including weakness, joint and contractures, and abnormal skin findings.

NAME        Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, including:
            Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS);
            Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome-Like Disorder (NBSLD)
DESCRIPTION Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Due to a founder mutation in the NBN gene, the disease is encountered most frequently among Slavic populations. Recently, a disease due to RAD50 deficiency has been reported. The patient displayed symptoms similar to NBS, microcephaly, mental retardation, bird-like face, and short stature. The MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks.

DESCRIPTION Providencia is a gram-negative urea-metabolizing bacilli that readily incorporates DNA from other bacteria, enabling it to acquire resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Providencia stuartii is a bacterium normally found in patients with indwelling urinary catheters, where it causes urinary tract infections. These infections may progress to bacteremia. Diarrhea, peritonitis, meningitis, and infections of burn wounds, the endocarditis and the brain abscess attributed to P. stuartii have also been reported.

DESCRIPTION Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to mutation in BLM (RecQ protein-like 3). This disease is characterized by dwarfism, photosensitivity, immunodeficiency and a high predisposition to various types of cancer. The function of BLM as a helicase and its role during the regulation of homologous recombination (HR) is well characterized. Recently, the role of BLM as a DNA damage sensor has been revealed.

DESCRIPTION MELAS Syndrome (Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a maternally inherited multisystem mitochondrial disorder. This disease is associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA and a biochemical deficiency of respiratory chain complex I. About 80% of MELAS patients have an A3243G mutation in the MTTL1 gene. Other mutations in MTTL1, other mitochondrial tRNA genes, and the mitochondrial MTND subunit genes of complex I have also been reported to cause MELAS.

NAME        Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency, including:
            Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency
DESCRIPTION Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in HADHA and HADHB. TFP is a multienzyme complex of the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. Human TFP is an octamer composed of four alpha-subunits harboring long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and four beta-subunits encoding long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. This disease includes a lethal neonatal phenotype with cardiomyopathy and Reye-like syndrome, an infantile hepatic phenotype with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and a childhood or adolescent-onset neuromyopathic phenotype with peripheral neuropathy and recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

ENTRY       H01353                      Disease
NAME        Chromobacterium violaceum infection
DESCRIPTION Chromobacterium violaceum is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that infects both humans and animals. The major symptoms in most of the cases with fatal results seem to be sepsis, multiple liver abscesses, and diffuse pustular dermatitis. Some studies have reported instances of untreated C. violaceum causing brain abscess and diarrhea. Recent findings indicate that the type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by Chromobacterium pathogenicity islands 1 and 1a (Cpi-1/-1a) is critical for C. violaceum pathogenesis.

NAME        Leigh syndrome, including:
            Leigh syndrome, French-Canadian type (LSFC);
            X-linked Leigh syndrome
DESCRIPTION Leigh syndrome is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Most frequently the central nervous system is affected, with psychomotor retardation, seizures, nystagmus, optic atrophy, ataxia, or respiratory failure. Some patients also present with peripheral nervous system involvement or non-neurologic abnormalities. In the majority of cases, dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex or of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are responsible for the disease. Patterns of inheritance include X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, and mitochondrial.

            MERRF syndrome;
            Fukuhara syndrome
DESCRIPTION Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged-Red Fiber Disease (MERRF) is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterized by myoclonic seizures, cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, and ragged-red fibers (RRFs) on muscle biopsy. RRFs are muscle fibers with subsarcolemmal mitochondria that stained red with Gomori trichrome stain. The MERRF syndrome is most commonly caused by the A8344G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA Lys gene.

DESCRIPTION Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a T-cell mediated skin inflammation caused by repeated skin exposure to contact allergens. Although regarded as a dermatosis that is typically triggered by environmental factors, ACD may affect certain individuals more easily than others. A higher risk for polysensitization has been found for polymorphism in the TNFA (TNFA-308) and IL-16 (IL-16-295 C/C) genes.

NAME        Atopic dermatitis
DESCRIPTION Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus. A genetic defect in the filaggrin (FLG) protein and/or environmental factors are thought to cause AD by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation. Apart from FLG, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs)  have identified many susceptibility loci of atopic dermatitis with genome-wide significance.

NAME        Anaphylaxis
DESCRIPTION Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, systemic allergic reaction that is almost always unanticipated and may lead to death by airway obstruction or vascular collapse. Anaphylaxis can be triggered by a broad range of triggers. Food is the commonest trigger in children and drugs the commonest in adults. In addition to the environmental influences, studies suggest that a complex of genes affects the anaphylactic response. Anaphylaxis occurs as the result of an allergen response, usually immunoglobulin E-mediated, which leads to mast cell and basophil activation and a combination of dermatologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms.

NAME        Allergic rhinitis
DESCRIPTION Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammation of nasal mucosa mediated by IgE-associated processes, which is characterised by pruritus, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and nasal congestion. The development of AR entails a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to different factors, of which the most important is the implicated allergen. Single-nucleotide polymorphism studies involving genes encoding for molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of AR have also been made. Such molecules comprise chemokines and their receptors, interleukins and their receptors, eosinophil peroxidase and leukotrienes, among others.

NAME        Eosinophilic esophagitis
DESCRIPTION Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune and antigen-mediated clinicopathologic disease that is characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the esophageal epithelium and results in esophageal fibrosis and dysfunction. Several factors contribute to the development of EoE, including genetic predisposition, history of allergies, and presence of environmental and food allergens. Recently, an association between a single nuclear polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) or eotaxin-3 (CCL-26) and risk for EoE was found.

NAME        Dermatitis herpetiformis
DESCRIPTION Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, polymorphic, pruritic skin disease that develops mostly in patients with latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. There is an association with the genotypes HLA DR3, HLA DQw2, found in 80-90% of cases. Owing to the granular immunoglobulin (Ig) A deposition at the tips of the papillary dermis and to the subepidermal blister formation associated with neutrophilic accumulations underlying the basement membrane, DH is considered to be an autoimmune blistering disease.

DESCRIPTION Bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection caused by bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are likely to be caused by viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than viral infection. The contact lens wearers are associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis or keratitis.

NAME        Infantile liver failure, including:
            Infantile liver failure syndrome (IFLS);
            Transient infantile liver failure (LFIT)
DESCRIPTION Infantile liver failure is a life-threatening condition characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, jaundice, distended abdomen, hemorrhagic diathesis, and hypoactivity. Clinically, patients manifest with elevated liver transaminases, hypoglycemia, cholestasis, coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia. It has been reported that infantile liver failure syndrome is caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes. A transient form of infantile liver failure is caused by mutation in the TRMU gene, which encodes a mitochondria specific tRNA-modifying enzyme.

DESCRIPTION Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is a mitochondrial disease that is caused by the lack of the COX. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV). Since COX is encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes, COX deficiency can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or a maternal pattern. Patients can present with a number of different clinical phenotypes, including Leigh syndrome, Fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

            NARP syndrome [DS:H01363];
            Mitochondrial infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (MIBSN)
DESCRIPTION ATP synthase deficiency is mitochondrial disease caused by inborn defects in the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (respiratory chain complex V). Many patients die within a few months or years. It have been shown to result from mutations in mtDNA genes for the subunits ATP6 and ATP8 or in nuclear genes encoding the biogenesis factors ATPAF2 and TMEM70. Recently, mutations has been found in a nuclear encoded structural complex V subunit, ATP5E and ATP5A1.

DESCRIPTION Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia is autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by severe hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, and nephrocalcinosis. It has been reported that mutations in the vitamin D-metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 cause this disease. The presence of CYP24A1 mutations explains the increased sensitivity to vitamin D in patients with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia.

DESCRIPTION Achromobacter xylosoxidans, also known as Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, is an environmental opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial infections targeting immunocompromised patients suffering from cancer, advanced HIV, diabetes mellitus or chronic renal failure. A. xylosoxidans is highly resistant to a broad range of antibiotics including resistance to narrow-spectrum penicillins, aminoglycosides and several cephalosporins. This bacterium can rarely cause keratitis in patients who had worn contact lenses.

NAME        Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
DESCRIPTION Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked, hereditary disorder due to mutations in the G6PD gene, resulting in protein variants with different levels of enzyme activity, that are associated with a wide range of biochemical and clinical phenotypes. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. More than 400 biochemical variants of G6PD deficiency have since been defined, and grouped into five classes based on enzyme activity and clinical manifestations. The most common clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice and acute haemolytic anaemia, which in most patients is triggered by an exogenous agent. A G6PD-deficient patient lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans.

DESCRIPTION Acrofacial dysostosis (AFD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders combining mandibulofacial dysostosis (micrognathia and ear anomalies) with limb defects. The predominantly preaxial form is called Nager AFD, the predominantly postaxial form of AFD (POADS) is also known as the Genee-Wiedemann or Miller syndrome. Among several AFDs, causative mutations have recently been identified in an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis in association with Miller syndrome, and in a component of the pre-mRNA spliceosomal complex with respect to Nager syndrome.

NAME        Antithrombin III deficiency;
            Inherited Antithrombin deficiency
DESCRIPTION Inherited Antithrombin (AT) deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pregnancy loss. AT is a potent inactivator of thrombin and factor Xa and the major inhibitor of blood coagulation. This disease is divided into type I deficiency, in which both the functional activity and antigenic levels AT are proportionately reduced, and type II deficiency, in which normal antigen levels are found in association with low AT activity due to a dysfunctional protein. Type II deficiencies can be further subclassified into three types, depending on the location of the mutations. Type IIa is caused by mutations that affect AT's reactive site. Type IIb is characterized by an abnormality of the heparin-binding domain. Type IIc variants are a pleiotropic group of mutations near the reactive loop site.

DESCRIPTION Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by severely elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, xanthomas, and the development of premature cardiovascular disease. Hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor gene consists of a number of distinct functional domains such as signal sequence, ligand binding, and so on. There are more than 1600 mutations in the LDLR gene that can cause familial hypercholesterolemia, accounting for up to 95% of all cases.

ENTRY       H01384                      Disease
NAME        The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS), including:
            Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS);
            Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO)
DESCRIPTION The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) is the mitochondrial disease, that is caused by mutations of the POLG1 gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma enzyme. ANS includes the phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO). MIRAS is a common cause of autosomal recessive juvenile- or adult-onset ataxia, at least in Scandinavia. Most cases of SANDO present with an initial stage of sensory neuropathy, a second stage of progressive external ophahlmoplegia and dysarthria, which is then followed by other symptoms, often with epilepsia or myoclonus.

DESCRIPTION Rienhoff syndrome is a congenital syndrome presenting at birth with distal arthrogryposis, hypotonia, bifid uvula, and a failure of normal post-natal muscle development but no evidence of vascular disease. A mutation in TGFB3 was identified suggesting that decreased TGF-beta signaling from a loss of TGFB3 activity is likely responsible for the clinical phenotype.

NAME        Hyperprolactinemia
DESCRIPTION Hyperprolactinemia unrelated to pregnancy is a disorder characterized by excess production of prolactin and may result in infertility, hypogonadism, and galactorrhea. Such nonphysiological hyperprolactinemia is caused mainly by drugs or by tumors in the anterior pituitary gland, which are usually identifiable by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some cases are due to prolactinomas and lesions in the pituitary stalk. A human germline PRLR mutation has been found in familial isolated hyperprolactinemia.

NAME        Cole disease
DESCRIPTION Cole disease is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by congenital or early-onset punctate keratoderma associated with irregularly shaped hypopigmented macules, which are typically found over the arms and legs, but not the trunk or acral regions. Mutations in ENPP1, encoding ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), are associated with Cole disease. ENPP1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and generates extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate.

NAME        POLG related disorders, including:
            Alpers syndrome [DS:H01389];
            Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS);
            The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS)  [DS:H01384];
            Myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA);
            Progressive external ophthalmoplegia [DS:H01118]
DESCRIPTION Except for autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, all of other POLG-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The POLG-related disorders comprise a continuous spectrum of overlapping symptoms and signs; and range from a rapidly fatal infantile cerebrohepatic disease to a progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) that may not present until the sixth decade of life. The POLG gene is comprised of a polymerase domain, linker region domain and exonuclease domain. Mutations in the polymerase domain tend to result in reduced synthesis of mtDNA. Exonuclease domain mutations result in a high frequency of randomly distributed rare mtDNA point mutations. Mutations within the Linker region can influence the association of POLG with the accessory subunit POLG2.

            Tick-borne lymphadenitis
DESCRIPTION Rickettsia species are arthropod-associated intracellular bacteria and cause diseases in human such as Tick-borne lymphadenopathy, Typhus fever and Spotted fever. Dermacentor marginatus and Dermacentor reticulatus are known vector of Rickettsia slovaca that is the main agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), which is found only in Europe. Its symptoms are generally mild and can be characterized by inoculation eschar on the scalp and cervical lymphadenopathies after a tick bite. Moreover, most of the cases occur during European cool months related to the activity of Dermacentor ticks.

DESCRIPTION Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, and may result in irreversible brain damage if not treated early and thoroughly. Hyperammonemia can be classified into primary or secondary hyperammonemias depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Detoxification of ammonia is mainly accomplished by the urea cycle in periportal hepatocytes. If the urea cycle is directly affected by a defect of any of the involved enzymes or transporters, this results in primary hyperammonemia.

DESCRIPTION Bacillus thuringiensis is a close taxonomic relative of Bacillus cereus and an insect pathogen that is widely used as a biopesticide. Additionally, this bacterium is known to induce myonecrosis in immunosuppressed mice after cutaneous infection. Human infection is unusual, and apart from gastrointestinal tract infections or those following laboratory contamination, there are only two clinical reports of B. thuringiensis infection. Both the cases were isolated from severe human tissue necrosis by burn wounds or severe war wounds.

DESCRIPTION Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, and may result in irreversible brain damage if not treated early and thoroughly. Hyperammonemia can be classified into primary or secondary hyperammonemias depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Detoxification of ammonia is mainly accomplished by the urea cycle in periportal hepatocytes. The function of the urea cycle may be affected in a secondary way in a number of different situations. For example, intermediary metabolites that accumulate due to enzymatic defects in other pathways, may inhibit the urea cycle. The most relevant group of disorders in this respect is that of organic acidemias. The urea cycle function may be impaired by substrate deficiencies assumed cause in various disorders including lysinuric protein intolerance, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency, and fatty acid oxidation defects. In addition to the urea cycle, mammals require the function of glutamine synthetase to completely detoxify ammonia.

NAME        Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infection
DESCRIPTION The genus Staphylococcus known as pathogen of human and other mammals causes various diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bacteremia. The two major opportunistic pathogens in the Staphylococcus genus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis, colonize a sizable portion of the human population. S. epidermidis as the predominant species is quite widespread throughout the cutaneous ecosystem, whereas S. aureus colonizes primarily on mucosal surfaces. Staphylococcal infections are commonly caused by S. aureus. However, the infections due to S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci have been also increasing. S. epidermidis is primarily associated with infections of implanted medical devices, such as prosthetic heart valves and joint prostheses. The treatments of staphylococcal infections are complicated by the development of antibiotic resistance, and the remaining effective treatment against most strains of multidrug-resistant staphylococci, including MRSA and MRSE, is the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

            Porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris;
            Acrokeratoelastoidosis
DESCRIPTION Punctate palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKPs) are rare autosomal-dominant inherited skin diseases that are characterized by multiple hyperkeratotic plaques distributed on the palms and soles. PPKPs are classified into 3 types; PPKP1 (Brauer-Buschke-Fischer disease), PPKP2 (porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris), and PPKP3 (Acrokeratoelastoidosis lichenoides). PPKP has previously been mapped to chromosomal region 15q22-15q24 and region 8q24.13-8q24.21, but the molecular basis has not been identified yet. Recently, it has been reported that nonsense mutations in AAGAB gene cause PPKP1.

NAME        Lactococcus garvieae infection
DESCRIPTION Lactococcus garvieae, catalase-negative, facultative anaerobic cocci, is a major pathogen of fish and causes fatal hemorrhagic septicemia in fish such as yellowtail and trout, and it has also been isolated from buffaloes with mastitis, and clinical specimens of human blood, urine, and skin. However, it is an unusual human pathogen. Only a few infections have been described so far, including several cases of infective endocarditis on native or prosthetic valve, one case of osteomyelitis, and septicaemia with liver abscess.

NAME        Streptococcus suis infection
DESCRIPTION Streptococcus suis, a Gram positive coccus, is a zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. Although it is generally carried asymptomatically in adult pigs, it can cause severe systemic disease in piglets, manifested as a rapidly fatal sepsis associated with meningitis, polyarthritis and pneumonia. The first case in humans was reported in Denmark in 1968. Human infection with S. suis occurs sporadically in Europe and North-America and case reports suggest that it is almost exclusively related to occupational exposure to pigs or pork products. Incidences of human infection with S. suis are greater in S.E. Asia and China. Meningitis is the most common presentation in humans, but septicaemia and endocarditis are also seen.

NAME        Periodontal diseases
DESCRIPTION During the early stages of the periodontal disease, saccharolytic, aerobic Streptococcus spp. and other bacteria adhere to and colonize the tooth enamel and root surface. This sets the stage for Fusobacterium nucleatum to coaggregate with these early colonizers and to permit late colonizers, including dental pathogens, to eventually form a biofilm. These complex interactions result in the release of factors that lead to tooth decay. Physical interaction is very specific among various genera in this complex microbial community. Due to the unusual length, adhesive nature, and other cell surface properties of F. nucleatum, periodontal disease-causing bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Streptococcus spp. aggregate and thrive; hence, F. nucleatum is thought of as a 'bridge bacterium'.

NAME        Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection
DESCRIPTION Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive human commensal bacterium persistently colonizing the anterior nares of about 30% of the human population. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is known to have evolved from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) after acquiring the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element which includes the mecA gene coding for resistance to the antibiotic methicillin. A highly cytotoxic and clinically virulent methicillin-sensitive strain, S. aureus strain 6850 is a well-characterized prototype strain isolated from a patient with a skin abscess which had progressed to S. aureus bacteremia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and multiple systemic abscesses.

NAME        Anaerobic infection
DESCRIPTION Anaerobic infections are common and some are serious with a high mortality rate. The clinically important anaerobes are several genera of Gram-negative rods (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Bilophila). Among the Gram-positive anaerobes, there are cocci (primarily Peptostreptococcus) and sporeforming (Clostridium) and non-sporeforming bacilli (especially Actinomyces and Propionibacterium). In terms of frequency, there are four major sites of anaerobic infection - pleuropulmonary, intra-abdominal, female genital tract, and skin and soft tissue infections (with or without involvement of underlying bone). Infectious diseases caused by these anaerobes include following symptoms, bacteremia, brain abscess, neck space infections and infections following head and neck surgery, chronic sinusitis and otitis media, dental and oral infections, pleuropulmonary infections, intra-abdominal infections, female genital tract infections, non-puerperal breast abscesses and diabetic foot ulcers.

NAME        Saccharomonospora viridis infection
DESCRIPTION Saccharomonospora viridis is the type species of the genus Saccharomonospora which belongs to the family Pseudonocardiaceae. Members of the species are frequently found in hot compost and hay, and its spores can cause farmer's lung disease, bagassosis, and humidifier fever. Spores of S. viridis are readily dispersed in air, and the prolonged exposure to spores can apparently result in acute respiratory distress which may lead to irreversible lung damage.

NAME        Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
DESCRIPTION Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne systemic emerging haemorrhagic fever. The causative agent, SFTS virus (SFTSV), is a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and considerable changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has 10-15% mortality rate, commonly because of multiorgan dysfunction. No specific treatment of SFTS is available, and avoiding tick bites is an important measure to prevent the infection and transmission of SFTSV.

NAME        Acute encephalitis
DESCRIPTION Acute encephalitis is a serious form of neurological disease caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. It is generally characterized by the acute onset of fever, altered mental status, new onset of focal neurological symptoms, and generalized or focal seizures. It can be produced by various etiologies, but viral infection and autoimmune disorders are the most common. Causes of acute viral encephalitis are herpes simplex virus, other herpes viruses, adenoviruses, influenza A, and so on. Mortality rates range between 7 % and 18 %, and severe disability has been reported in up to 56 % of survivors.

DESCRIPTION Condyloma acuminatum is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-6, HPV-10, and HPV-11 are predominately found in the anogenital region and causing approximately 90% of this disease. They appear as fleshy papules on the mucosa and skin of the anorectum and genitalia, with genital disease being more prevalent than anorectal disease. The warts tend to be painless, but may be associated with some discomfort or itching.

NAME        Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
DESCRIPTION Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe viral illness caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic cases imported in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the United States of America. MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS.

NAME        Pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF)
DESCRIPTION Pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) is a syndrome attributed to human adenovirus B, particularly serotype 3, which causes small outbreaks, mainly among children. The syndrome may occur sporadically and can cause outbreaks in families and other closed populations. The main sources of infection are contaminated waters of swimming pools and water reservoirs. Acute onset of PCF comprises fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis, cervical adenopathies and bulbar and palpebral conjunctivitis with moderate follicular reaction which can last for 3-5 days. PCF associated ocular inflammation begins unilateral and generally becomes bilateral in the course of the disease.

NAME        Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis
DESCRIPTION Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a rapidly progressive and highly contagious viral disease characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes with subconjunctival hemorrhages, excessive tearing, and photophobia. A palpebral conjunctival follicular reaction, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and congestion are common. Symptoms start after an incubation period of 12 to 48 hours, and the clinical signs usually disappear in 1 to 2 weeks. Enterovirus 70 (EV70) and coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) have caused large outbreaks of AHC. The AHC epidemic had begun in 1969 in Ghana and spread across Africa to India and the Far East, with small outbreaks in Europe.

DESCRIPTION Enterobacteriaceae are among the most common human pathogens, causing community-acquired as well as hospital-acquired infections. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been increasingly reported worldwide. Bacterial acquisition of carbapenemases, enzymes that inactivate carbapenems, is crucial to the emergence of CRE. In 2001, the first report of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying a new carbapenemase, KPC, was published.

ENTRY       H01423                      Disease
NAME        Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infection
DESCRIPTION Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common causative pathogen in community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs), including acute otitis media, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. It is also a major cause of bacteremia. Pneumococcal antibiotic resistance towards different families of antibiotics, in particular, penicillin and the macrocodes, continues to be a much-debated issue. The main mechanism of resistance in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae involves the alteration of penicillin target proteins, the so-called penicillin binding protein (PBPs), which cause reduced affinities and/or binding capacities for the antibiotic molecule.

NAME        Group A streptococcal pharyngitis;
            Group A streptococcal tonsillitis;
            Group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis
DESCRIPTION Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an acute infection of the oropharynx and/or nasopharynx that is caused by group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Group A streptococcus is responsible for 5-15% of cases of pharyngitis in adults and 20-30% of cases in children, and is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis. The disorder is primarily a disease of children between 5 and 15 years of age, and, in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. The onset of symptoms in patients is often abrupt. In addition to throat pain, symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and particularly in younger children abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis are not typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, and, if present, they suggest an alternative cause such as a viral infection. In most persons, fever resolves within 3-5 days, and throat pain resolves within 1 week, even without specific treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of subsequent development of acute rheumatic fever and suppurative complications.
